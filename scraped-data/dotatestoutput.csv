I ll do what , did after TI5 ; A thread dedicated for the shuffle and what not .
General info :



Black ^ leaves / gets kicked from Fnatic
Mynuts kicked from Alliance
So apparently , according to v1lat ; Era is making a team with synderella ( syndereN )
Silent to replace Illidan in VP :
Col loses their only sub and ex carry
1437 joins DC . C9 's future looking bad .
Ohaiyo has confirmed there wo nt be changes to Fnatic .
Vega twitter guy confirms no changes .
Funn1k to start playing for Empire , at least for Dreamleague LAN next week
Mineski confirm no roster changes
MyNuts ( 4 )
Illidan ( 1 )
Black ^ 1 )
Xtinct ( 4 )
Jonassomfan ( 3 )
Beesa ( 1 )
7ckingmad ( 1 / 4 / 5 )
Waga ( 2 )
Welp , looks like Kebap or Pablo will be Alliance 's 5th player going into the roster lock .
Sad too , I thought MyNuts was playing really well . Hopefully he will find a new team sometime after the Majors .

Black and Xtinct now free agents
Add Black ^ to the free agents

Can add MyNuts to the free agent list :
sad , alliance kick mynuts instead of loda who is the problem , obviously they wont kick him

Black 's probably out of Fnatic . I wonder who 's the support though . Xtinct ? Net ?
did nt they lock already ?
nope , not yet . Ohaiyo did stated in an interview after the majors that they were going to stick together but I guess things may have changed though . No real confirmation yet .
Does nt really confirm anything

,

I know Alliance was never gonna kick Loda and Akke but I thought about a potential surprise roster change for this shuffle and thats s4 and Bulldog leaving and making a team with Zai or smth lol
zai is still at school , cant play competitive right now + already registered as Sub for EG .
Bulldog is one of their best players . Maybe the best now that mynuts is out .
thats what im saying , sooner or later he knows if they keep failing they will have to split just like Dendi and Xboct did
edited : well nvm just saw his twitter
can you give the link of black leaving , saw ADTR standing in for while ( like official statement i mean )
yeah I m confused .
maybe . but still not confirmed yet though
I m gonna miss seeing a Tusk in almost every [ A ] game .
Edit : looks like its
5
its old Ehome . King
we ca nt really say that though , they won against OG with silent , but it 's too early to say they ll achieve or fail with this change , though i agree that i liked illidan more for VP
[ deleted ]

,

Mynuts just got kicked from Alliance

,

Mason and Ritsu on one team , oh my . Also all they did was replace 1437 with mason and swap around the roles .
that teams gonna be better than DC tho .
Who is gonna practice with them ? Ritsu shat away his career .
im sure EG would , t3 NA teams and peruvians would too
They re pretty decent from what I ve seen .
does anyone have any info about Shanghai main Qualifiers ?
more info when the rosters are locked
Where 's Illidan going ? I see he 's not under free agents .

?
well fuck , i thought they were nt making changes to fnatic
I think fng also said roster changes are nt likely but they still kicked illidan . Might also not be referring to fnatic , who knows .
BibleThump
fnatic plays with a standin for black ^ currently vs mineski

,

literally 4
Beesa is playing Canada cup on a team called FDL . int . The roster is Beesa , 04 , fronz , corey and rime .
What are the roles ?
Beesa , playing the carry .

reminder that teams who lock - in their roster and make a change to their roster will be sent to open qualifiers for the Shanghai major .

That was just a rumor
It 's the opposite .
Jerax to Liquid , source :
?
? He already was in Liquid .
i think he just meant he 's officially registered for the major now

the news we wanted
Sumail still isnt locked in the roster :
Lol , Sumail is nt going anywhere . You are delusional . Who would they replace him with ?
Brax Kappa
Guess Qojqva is taking a break for another season , please come back Q - God .
well if memory serves right , after the pre - ti5 mouz disbanded , he left for school didnt he ?
after ti6 we ll see zai and qojqva back . i hope
Who 's really gonna take ritsu ?
Mason replacing 1437 ? Is Mason support then ?
Ah okay , thanks .
I struggle to follow US doto because of time differences :
I thought Zai was EG 's sub ?
Only registered today , OP does nt update the thread automatically
Actually . could this work ?
this is a joke right ?

,

Synderen 's stack by role
Kinda like EG .
who is slickz ?

wow i did not know you can actually get useful information in this subreddit
Just wait until Dire secret shop gets an aghs upgrade .

Thanks I didnt know this :
You re welcome
ITT : I know this so everyone else must know this . It is useless to share this information on this sub dedicated to Dota 2 and this should be considered common knowledge . There is no way a less experienced player would ever come to this sub for any reason and therefore this should be deleted . Op is a faggot for posting this content which is clearly known by everyone who plays dota and should have posted some aghs upgrade meme instead .
Thanks for sharing OP . I did nt know and I appreciate the tip .
+ 5 % winrate dire this week
Did you watch recent purge 's pheonix video too ?
Nah , found this out myself a long time ago actually . Thought this was uncommon knowledge .
I thought it was common knowledge :
It is common knowledge
did nt know this , but may be because I do nt play mid these days : still might be useful , thanks !
It is , people just pretend it 's not because they know about it .
Grats on learning one of many basic mid mechanics !
This is not a basic mid mechanic .
ITT : 9k redditors .
there 's one if you re going up the ramp from top rune , in the trees
There ` s another coming from the offlane radiant .
daily 9k mmr reddit thread
I did nt know which specific tree I have to cut to access the secret shop , but knew about the possibility itself .
Still very surprised to see useful stuff on the frontpage these days . Thanks .
Why is this simple , yet useful tip on the front page ? Where are my memes ? s
This is something that has been around since dota 1 days . I m surprised not more people know about it .
When I m mid and might need something from the secret shop any time soon ( mostly energy booster for Arcane Boots or a point booster ) I always use my tango on that tree at some point
Was like this in HoN already and that game is pretty old .
Dire winrate increased by . 01 %
oh , i thought everybody knows that ;

Me 2 .
Damn you RTZ for ruining our Alladin 's heart .
If Universe was nt the best offlaner out there EG would have long kicked him for not being a massive twat like the rest of them .
classic " eg arent role models xD " retard comment
Fear is cool but i can agree with the rest
Fear is a rager in pubs too , telling people to kill themselves etc .
He embodies the history of Na dota
he does . and he knows when to be professional and sellout . perfect combo for an org like eg . and we can tell from the results .
Just let it roll over you
Literally everybody does that .
Have you seen s4 stream ?
And ? S4 still rages believe it or not . You just do nt see it on his stream .
so you agree that Fear is more honest with his viewers ?
Only when he 's on camera . He just cares more about how the community views him .
I do nt .
lmao good one
If I havnt told at least 3 people per game to kill themselves then I dont consider it a proper game of dota .
And that makes you a massive twat as well .
I often tell my techies to kill themselves , we usually win ganks , teamfights , and denies exp to the enemy .
Awww did someone say something nasty to you in a computer game over the Internet :
There are not few people who suffer from severe depression and take those things to heart . Getting angry is okay but telling people to kill themselves shows how immature you are .
If they suffer from severe depression why the fuck are they playing dota . I cant imagine a more depressing game .
Also it 's a good fucking game .
How is anyone on EG ( except maybe SumaiL ) a twat ?
Who does nt rage in pubs though ?
Aui , Universe , Waga , Merlini to name a few
I mean merlini is on a state of trance when he casts , he couldnt possibly get mad .
I do nt .
Not saying these guys are perfect or even near perfect at controlling their attitudes , but to call them " massive twats " for being your usual pub player in ranked matches is plain wrong . The only person that was truly awful in pubs was SumaiL , but he 's been a lot better in the past few months .
If many people are toxic in pubs it means many people are twats , not that nobody is . Just because some people are assholes it does nt make it ok for everybody else to be assholes too .
This site 's obsession with taking the moral highground over pro players , especially NA ones , is just stupid .
* paid
yes sorry !
RTZ does it a hell of a lot more than I do , and that 's just on his stream .
And Fear frequently tells people to kill themselves , which is a lot worse than w33 or Dendi do .
And since when has Rime been a reddit favorite ?
Rime 's been a reddit favorite recently because of his casting , even though he 's said some really fucked up stuff in pubs . And w33 has told people to kill themselves in pubs before .
Does it really matter ? They re all assholes either way .
That is what he meant . He is nt
Right ty , I missed the " not " part , edited

I see how highly your own meme
Or he said no while the other 3 said yes .
Is it too late now to say sorry ?
Or he thought it was for the better of the team . Cant let friendship get in the way . Whether they were right or left , we have yet to see .
Better for EG to never win again .
It 's better for the team to kick Fear and replace him with Aui . That was nt the decision though .
It was my opinion at the time and still is now . Results are evidence in my favour . DAC + TI5 vs absolutely nothing .
oh my sweet summer child
too bad Universe already locked in for EG and Aui for DC or else there would be endless speculation because of this post
actually not endless , until Dec 8th Kappa
kick rtz please
Universe already locked in for EG this season .
BibleThump
Thank you for once again sharing a completely random twitter post by a dota personality . I truly care for how he is feeling .
:
,
fuck universe if he agrees to kick aui for no reason and then do shit like this




























So I propose that we get at least the option to turn off the Reborn menu sound when we re in a game , no matter if we play or watch .
This sounds occurs in game too when nothing happens and it 's annoying as fuck .




























Since the patch has hit I have nt seen a single techies be somewhat useful , has anyone seen somebody make it work ?
Here is what you do with Techies to be decent :
Firstly , you have to pick him when the time is right . He was highly situational even before the nerfs , and now much more so . Pick Techies when at least one ( preferably more ) of the following is true :
4 ) The opposing team wants to be very mobile , finding pickoffs , etc . We are talking heroes like Storm Spirit , Slark , Clinkz , Bloodseeker , Pudge ; those moving around the map , often initiating fights . Mines can put a stop to that pretty quickly . In fact , Landmines are a decently effective ( and hilarious ) counter to invisibility in general , due to blowing up on them whether they are invisible or not .
Alright , you ve picked Techies . Now what ? Well , first I want to share with you a secret :
etc .
1 ) Your partners snowball off of essentially free kills and win the game . Focus on vision - mines and having a few killing stacks in weird but accessible ( by your repositioning allies ) places
4 ) Focus on spreading mines everywhere to , deny them the mobility they need to get the kills they need to snowball .
TL
TL ; DR : very situational pick , be smart about mine placement .
wtf , a tldr defeats the purpose of this post . it takes like two or three minutes to read lol
what a fucking stupid long post
I stopped playing ranked when techies was strong , came back to ranked a few days back and Techies goes godlike :
I think the only way he can be useful is if he goes back to the past way of playing him , placing mines all over the place like traps . But he needs to have the aoe gold and exp on a kill global again . Too OP ?
Just place mines . Lots , and lots , of mines .
I used to rush towers with mines and then go aghs , bloodstone etc . Then just throw remote mines at people . Is this still viable ? Have nt tried it in 6 . 85 .
Here is your summary :



,
I m sure you re a joy to meet in pubs
Lol no . Fuck Techies . He deserved what he got .
I do nt know about you but I m pretty happy that I do nt have to deal with every other game lasting 80 - 90 minutes because someone picked Techies .
Techies ancients kappa
i just do what i always did .
go offlane get first blood get forcestaff and aghs then you ruin the game and have fun making fun of the enemy team when they fail .

~ 4 . 5k normal que
Here is your summary :



,
No support = no vision = ez game . Techies is not good just because u won against 5 carries
[ deleted ]
Yes , I have . It 's called trench tier techies rape
stfu
dont mine only place bombs




























Since 6 . 84 Alchemist can gift Aghs to allies when he get fully farmed and 6 slotted , this situation happens almost never , really never happens even if you try to do it you make the team loose because you are an alch and you have bad builds and you give a fuck and then doto happens
But ( in 6 . 86 ) it could be at least good consume the Aghs ? may when you consume it you only get the upgrade like a passive for your ultimate spell ( or normal spell for some heroes ) but you dont get that extra life / mana points and stats like that normal item does ( of course that alche ability will no longer be in the game )
Alchemist does nt need to be fully farmed and 6 slotted to gift aghs .




























On general behaviour in DotA
Another example is that players try to justify their negative behaviour by saying it are the other players who are at fault , So I am justified by insulting and verbally harassing other players . I think the fact remains that this is the case ( as in , its a fact that players reason like this ) it is however very wrong to do so .
I m going to be honest with you dude , literally no one is going to fucking read this thing .
Those who want to can , those we do nt can .
huh
All I am saying is that , if someone wants to read it , they could and if they do nt they still have the possibility .
I am simple man , I see long post , I upvote .
























































All of these aghs ideas has given me an idea : Aghanim 's Spectre !
Edit : I wanted to add some more notes .
I am just trying to contribute possible ideas to the next patch . Spectre needs a little something to become competitive again .
alright , now it 's really old
Almost as old as Aghanim himself .
I am a simple man . I see shitpost , I upvote
Up . You . Go !
aghanim 's spectre haha thats really funny dude
Thanks . It 's not so fun typing Aghanim 's Spectre on a phone . Android wants to autocorrect both .
This is so fun that everyone on this subreddit is feeling inclined to make these works of art .
I am glad that you appreciated it !





























Active : Shitpost : Create a new balance suggestion for 6 . 86 to post on Reddit . After a delay , that balance change is applied .
Thank you for taking the time to read my suggestion . The numbers can be tweaked if it is imbalanced .
good shit go sHit thats some goodshit rightth ere rightthere if i do a so my sel i say so thats what im talking about right there right there ( chorus : mMMMM O0OOOOooo Good shit
Upvote for riki .

Active : OP can go and Fuck themselves .
this isnt even funny
Does nt Omni already have that aura or was it tusk
save us mr lizard




























Yo , I saw a lot of people talk about these kind of videos but nobody ever made one and seeing as I really like custom games I thought I could take it in my own hands . I am very much open to feedback as it is a first for me as well , so please let me know what you liked and what you did nt like about it . I already have a few more games I mind that I want to create videos like this for , Overlord " would be next .
I think they re pretty useful to help people try out new custom games
This game is awesome , but needs some work . Hopefully it will get big enough to have dedicated servers so that I do nt have 900 ping .
So you hate the guy because of something he ca nt change ? You re kidding me right ?





























i think hes broken
I say this because i have no idea how to clear Twitch cancer .
would nt tinker laser be better treatment ?
Yeah but he is a trash pick ATM
He needs that flame guard .
You can keep your magic .
its terminal
the fact that this is only 4 words makes it perfect

One . He meant the silent kappa .
Welcome to DotA ! Enjoy your stay !
Who ? Arteezy , or Ember ? 0 Kappa .
Nah man , that 's how you get good . It 's how arteezy is one of the best in the world , cause he 's so dedicated . To us scrubs it seems like madness , but it is truly Artour 's genius at work
are nt we all ?

Pretty good one .
Someone with timestamp of the vod ?
If you mean the donation it happened here

forward to : 03 . 08 . 00
FYI you can timestamp twitch links

Same vod link as above but it was 02 : 41 : 30 on the timestamp

" What is going on " Death line 1
" How you do that " Death line 2
Only four words , checks out .
Four words is plenty .

It happened before , anyone remember
?
just deny yourself my man
How is Arteezy Ember and Richard Lewis alike ?
They both choke at LANs .
This joke is wasted here
Hes sorry .
Did nt delete his lies .
And apologize .
Big plays ?
we ll be seeing it everywhere soon , do nt worry
this joke deserves its own thread
He choked loda at dreamhack
Yeah fuck me I did nt recognize the name
Bottom kek
Can anyone link ta shampoo song he played ?
This ?
Probably on youtube .
He is . special " boy , thats how .
How is this not available in america ?

Those girls are pretty neat .
I love how you can tell Arteezy plays the song from the comments .
[ deleted ]
I was not there , but sounds like shampoo , its pretty close . the 49 sec mark
Boys we broke him , let 's not get a new one .
This one was a nice harvest

Exactly : D
Balance in all Memes
pls no
Why ? His 44 % competitive win rate is too high for you ?
3 % more than when tinker was gutted , so prepare for the death of ember spirit
To be honest ember is counter able and fairly weak . I can see him getting a small nerf , maybe a + 2 base armor because he badly needs a base armor buff or some form of small stat gain buff .
But ember honestly is actually fairly balanced . Just more of his counters need to come into play .
I highly doubt he will get touched , I dont think we ve seen nearly as much Ember as we did Tinker when he got shit on . Besides , Ember is just fine , dont see what needs to be nerfed .
The only difference now is instead of him getting a Dagon 5 and Eblade at 25 minutes he has to wait until late game like every other fucking hero .
Though I do nt think tinker can fit the role of a carry . Typically carries are expected to BKB themselves up and murder everyone on the enemy team during teamfights . With the aid of initiation and general crowd control provided by his team )
no but reddit just posted a thread we are talking in . but im actually biased because im an ember player .
Ember is nowhere near the auto lane winner like Lesh was . I feel for them but seriously , 2 or 3 lightning strikes and you are heading back to the fountain .
2 for heavy int heroes , 3 for str based mids .
fuck em im special : D
it reminds me of this
I m pretty sure both will be nerfed
[ deleted ]
Make up your mind son
Techies clearly owned the competitive meta before the nerf right ? Hmm
Now again , why should ember be nerfed ?
I do nt necessarily disagree , but AM does nt require , initiation because his blink has a 0 . 4 sec cast time .
You might think that it does nt matter much , but you can very reliably hit things like euls > stun combo on AM , which is , hard to do against Ember .
Sure , but AM and Ember are not different only in cast times . Ember has the edge there , but AM 's stats and usual build paths make him much much tankier . AM 's escape is limited by his cast time , but Ember 's is limited by the Remnant limit and much higher manacost .
Anyway , I m not here to say that Ember is nt hard to catch , or that his ability to escape is nt his signature . I m just trying to say that its pretty balanced the way it is .
Not really , Ember has no cast point on his escape ( s ) so he can dodge a lot of short cast point stun ( if you are a pro level player obviously , not me ) which Anti - mage normally will not . So for example normally you can blink roar an AM but not an Ember .
Am is also limited in his escape by the blink range , whereas Ember usually has a remnant much further away .
Hes been like this for a while . If it takes this long for fucking people to realize hes good he does nt deserve a nerf .
Your mmr
4 , 5k
how is her OP ? his last change was in 6 . 81 , nothing has changed about the hero since , literally nothing .
he does nt need to be like storm did
my god i can see it now

PLS MR LIZARD
oh god no please just introduce it to captains and hire all the mmr spammers so he can enjoy 150 % p + b and gets deleted .
but if they ban ES
then what
besides you could abuse fountain pulls so navi wins a ti with it and then it gets " fixed " because it was actually jsut a bug boys

Reverse brew master . If earth / fire / storm spirit are all picked and have an aghs , they can form , a super brew master together . The controlling player is chosen randomly from the 3 spirits and the other 2 are placed in the new Super heroes inventory .
I ll explain .
This patch they nerf Ember , next patch they nerf Ebola Spirit and dunk him in the dumpster . Now you have the three spirits in the dumpster , right ?
Ok then it comes the new patch patch .
Ok , this is when things get interesting .
The next patch Pit Lord is added to the game , right ? No news here , we all know that . What you do nt know is that Pit Lord is coming from the dumpster himself . He will actually ult himself out of there and bring the spirits along with him . And the patch note will read :
Ember Spirit :
Storm Spirit :
Earth Spirit :
( Let 's be reasonable here , Ebola spirit needs no buff .

Please help !
On what grounds ? He 's situational pick in pro games and has an average win rate in pubs .
situational ? he had like 70 % p / b on major
Against certain teams . 70 % against Secret maybe but not many other teams play him very often and if they do it 's not very well
He had 63 % with another 10 heroes above him . He 's in a good place right now , the only thing that might need a change is increasing BoT 's cd .
If he had 10 above him that means he had 100 below him .
And less than 50 % winrate . He 's fine
can u fucking scroll down
Ember is so damn fun to play )
kunkka was too but then he got doomed
Or just left behind in the great power creep .
He isnt even OP , he just fits the meta right now and even then he is still a questionable carry .
His ult has to be nerfed . Either adding a manacost to place a spirit or increasing the cooldown .
Yeah , I do nt get why they do nt just run SumaiL Ember safelane and put Arteezy mid with SF , TA or one of his other mid heroes .
I think that 's the point maybe . Put Artour on the Ember safelane and have Sumail on another hero a la Secret .
Sumail already does ember safe
Yes focus on rtz more like Frankfurt rofl . Sumail is one of top 3 embers .
No , it gives them more flexibility .
He 's jealous of Ditya Ra 's performance
He was doing it before that game happened but I would say he is jealous of EE 's performance .
When he wanted mmr he used Ember before the major . probably just wants 8k
huh Why is this on front page
He 's a ferret , he thought it was a music but he 's too retarded to tell the difference RaccAttack
What happened after he abandoned yesterday ?
but he abandon 1 yesterday , and abandon 1 today . How did he not get into Low priority game ?
In exchange for a teammate taking the first abandon so Arteezy could safely abandon , the teammate would be able to become a moderator of Arteezy 's twitch channel .
ty , but did you see him abandon another game today ? The one that tiny asked mid
In exchange to be a twitch mod for his channel .
ty
Moderator power or Artour 's twitch chat .

Another front - page shitpost .
mom and dad once said " Artour do nt play ember , you re bad with ember " lmao those good old days .
Practice Ember when u already got Ember player in the team SeemsGood , dont practice Meepo , Huskar which PPD cant pick because their carries practice same heroes EleGiggle
I ve rarely seen him stream heroes that he plays at events .
You linked his twitch instead of a video by mistake
that divine rapier hit too hard .
Shitty shitty shitty shitty wizard .
I imagine chat was going nuts this whole time ?
How is he going to feel when Icefrog nerfs Ember in next weeks patch ?
so who 's replacing sumail on EG ?

But about rtz , I remember his dad said to him to not play ember during LANs .
6 . 86 - Remove Ember from CM
He used to not accept donations but then started taking them because " money " He had viewers before donations , and a lot of them too .
he talked about this essentially this donation accepting thin was after a talk with his dad and it was his way of helping the family i can respect that
He started taking donations when he was on Secret , AFAIK .




























: Urn of Shadows + Staff of Wizardry
Urn is a great support and ganking item that is usually bought because it provides a bit of mana regen an a bit of hp , along with it 's Soul Release being a good ability . I built on that in deciding which item to use in the upgrade recipe . Other options would be to use Ogre Club or one of the boosters . The upgrade to Soul Release on an ally makes it not a worthless item even when enemies are nt building evasion and I think is great for heros that have a bit more mana trouble but do nt want to or ca nt afford going into a bigger item with mana regen such as euls or orchid . I like the extra int because it could possibly offset the need for arcane boots and open up the option for phase or tranquils on more heros .
Like the idea , but it could use some tweaks :
Radiance does not give evasion . It gives the enemy miss chance , so reducing evasion wo nt do a single thing .




























If we want to be as shit as slacks subs at dota then we ll ask , do nt force it upon us .
im ,
Could nt get past the 1 min mark .




























but couldnt play ranked cause i dont have trophy experience level 50 wtf
So how did you calibrated if you couldnt play ranked in the 1st place ?
with the mmr trick
yea i didnt know i need level 50 anyway = that sux lol
So get a trophy
yea thats sucks im level 30 atm with 70 matches need to get 150 matches
Ofc you can play solo ranked , there 's a solution .
i cant cause i need to get trphy 50 first
Not to mention if you actually calibrated before ( in Source 1 ) you could play it regardless of trophy . Obvious smurf is obvious . Stop complaining about yourself cheating the system .
You are really stupid .
why ? D
Because its possible to play solo ranked without having that retarded trophy , you know ?
yea by going into a party and search ranked but cant do that all the time i need to be able to do it by myself cause i also calibrated
There 's a way to abuse the same to play solo ranked too .
tell me




























i would gladly search for 20 minutes per match just to not get this shit




























AND / OR
Make boulder smash channeled and the channel time equals the distance pushed .
No , it 's already almost impossible to use grip to save someone .
No , it 's not
600 shit pull speed to the location where ES pulled them ( not where he is )
Just force staff the shit out of him and silence enemies , will be better
I m sorry but no , even at 6k + I rarely see an ES doing a save with Grip , on paper it looks good but in reality it 's just unreliable , the grip speed is too slow currently to be reliable , it saves only in rare cases
yes exactly , increase the speed .




























Aghs reverts the Ball lightning mana cost to the 6 . 84 shit and he drops a remnant of current level at starting and ending points of the zip . Also number of overload charges increased to 2 / 3 / 4 per level of ball lightning .
Not shitpost kappa
Here 's an additional effect since the original sounds too weak .
And drops static remnants on its path
That 's 500 damage on a 0 - second cooldown . Even without the overload thing it would be OP . You could maybe add a remnant only to the , of the ball lightning , and only if it travels a certain minimum distance .
This sounds better , original idea would be broken .
Or make it a new ability , same cooldown as the original but on separate cooldown .
Add cooldown to the Ball Lightning Remnant
[ deleted ]
? that 's like 500 mana for 2k magic damage lol
[ deleted ]
The point is , nukes on a 0 - second cooldown are going to either be extremely OP ( spam it and instantly delete an enemy hero ) or extremely shit ( too expensive to use )
Ogre checking in
I love storm but you re actually retarded lol .
Alternatively , make his aghs where he does nt lose overcharge for attacking during ball .
This is actually good . Balance changes depend on icefraud , mine is just an idea .
I thought this was nt a shitpost ?
this isnt
Not shitpost ?
no
no ?
no
get out
this is actually far worse than the ironic shitposts u lied tbh
that sounds good to me
overload will become a bit too strong
How exactly are you wasting an item if it gives you something OP in return ?
Yes , that slot could potentially be a BKB . But you do nt have to get a BKB in every single game .
Exactly , you are not going to waste that 4200 gold that gives meh stats for a storm until it gives something op in return .
Does an aghs give Silencer something OP ? Why does he make it ?
It 's crazy how you just pull out an idea from nowhere and do nt even consider how much damage it can put out .
Not every hero needs an aghs upgrade and I think Storm is one of them .
Your suggestion is also way too overpowered and if storm does get an aghs upgrade it should be situationally good rather than objectively good .
One way or another everyone is going to have an Aghs upgrade in the end . That 's one of Icefrog 's goals .
But what if icefrog adds an interesting , balanced aghs upgrade to storm ? What 's wrong with that .
maybe , but icefraud can do the balance changes
How about overload now stacks for a maximum of 3 or 4 stacks . Which is released everytime he attacks .
which is exactly what i said
My thought was giving him an ability which gives off a strong lightning shock nuke in a small aoe around ss based on his current mana but then ss loses all of his mana potentially leaving him vulnerable .
nah would nt be good , no one wants a nuke which leaves with you no mana , even more so on SS .
I m talking a very strong nuke to justify a pickup once in a blue moon . Would be more of a gimmick aghs or good when you have aegis / cheese and get jumped on . Maybe could be used while stunned and be a strong dispel . Mostly just think he would be best with a highly situational aghs .




























Maybe is an in - game tweak thing ? I m sure it 's the correct driver .
Any suggestions as in other headsets around the same prize would be really appreciated as so far I m not very impressed with the headset and I do nt particularly recommend them .
I ve heard great things about it . That 's $ 400 . 00 dollars tho . I m not trying to spend that much at the moment .
They are nice . Are they comfortable ?
Yeah there pretty great .
They seem a bit big ?
I use them too , but I have to say that they do feel pretty cheap . I like them though , they re light and very comfortable . Really good value for money imo .




























- fix it 's angle hit , people complaining how easy to land shackle now
- the first unit who get shackled will get full duration stun , but if there 's unit behind it , the unit behind it will get stunned only half of it 's duration . This only happens on hero - hero shackle scenario , if the front target was creep , and behind them was hero , it will had full duration , both of them . Same on the trees
Or just reduce the duration to 2 . 75 instead of 3 . 75
Or maybe to 3 seconds
Anyways , maybe she wo nt be picked as much when the new meta arrives , le balanced 6 . 86
0 . 75 / 1 . 5 / 2 . 25 / 3 is fine

LOL BEST THING EVER
I missed this , who is that ? do you have a link ?

I think this is what madness looks like
Mid jakiro finally viable with octarine
Unfortunately I rarely get to experience the joy that is Jakiro mid . The stereotype that only " regular " mid heroes can go mid is too strong in my tier .
Jakiro mid is actually pretty strong if you know what you are doing , the JAKIRO JAKIRO JAKIRO guy on , proved this about a week ago .
My man !
Yes !
I always fuck up Ice Path when I m playing Rubick .
Too used to that ten year delay , friend ? I know the feeling too .
You said it .
I have no idea how to find Dotabuff games based on the lane you take , could check out my rare Jakiro mid games .
Yo , what 's ur skill build m8
Liquid Fire at 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 .
Or
Either way , I leave ult at lv1 just for the intimidation factor , since no one fights on the ult , might as well put the points in an efficient spell .
Get Aghs for more " intimidation " factor .
Obviously if you need more lockdown , or team support items you would nt build it but regardless it looks cool !
All depends on how the lane goes , IMO .
IMO , if you re playing position 5 , level 1 Liquid Fire is great for harassing squishy heroes out of lane right from the start to ease the harassment on your carry .
I do get Liquid Fire ( E ) at level 1 most of the time too , if that is what you meant . What I meant is that by lvl 7 or 8 I have usually maxed Dual Breath ( Q ) if the lane has any kill potential . Also a problem with this skill build is that I have little harass potential if a kill is not possible .
2 ) It costs no mana
3 ) It does nt grant wand charges which is pretty great in the laning phase
4 ) The cast range is much better than your right click
nice , lvl 1 ulti seems legit
what do u build , classic euls ? or force / glimmer ?
Depends on our team and theirs . If they have an Ember , then Euls . If they have a Clockwerk then Force . I never bought Glimmer on Jakiro ,
Every game 's different , and he needs to be built accordingly .
i feel liquid fire is so bad with just one or two points i just level dual breath first and then at 2 or 3 i get my first liquid fire depending on the kill / harass potential . if you analyze the ability , it is nearly useless at level 1 , and jakiro doesnt have mana issues to justify not leveling a spell
Its level 1 utility is that you get the ability to orb walk one right click to harass without drawing creep aggro .
I m 4 . 5k , thanks . And I find Dual breath at lv1 to be useles . It does semi - good damage , but I personally prefer Liquid fire . But hey that 's just my opinion .

You are nt supporting enough

I just hit creeps

even , got your dota 2 profile huh

it 's a

It 's a triangle within the pentagon deIlluminati
we know u fuck , it looks like a triangle so he calls it a triangle , fucking math nazi

that 's not a triangle though :
My graph does nt work at all . VOLVO PLZ .
One head for pushing , one head for pulling . Kreygasm
HOHO HAHA HOHO HAHA HOHO HAHA HOHO HAHA HOHO HAHA HOHO HAHA HOHO HAHA HOHO HAHA HOHO HAHA HOHO HAHA
Cool .
Yep .
both those heroes should have more farm on their pentagon .
Why more farm on shaman ? Creep clearing is pretty easy with Jakiro , I d think it would be a bit easier to get last hits as Jakiro compared to most supports
rhasta can stack and clear with ether shock , and can also ether shock waves
a similar principle applies to heroes like sand king and earthshaker , though hard 5 earthshaker is definitely more viable than hard 5 visage / rhasta / sandking .
Really ? I call this a shitpost .
How do you have so little farm as jakiro ?
ITT : players with likely lower mmr than OP criticize OP for his playstyle based on a pentagon
It was a question . The hero is very good at clearing waves , you have to actively avoid it to have that little farm . Unfortunately , I also have higher MMR than OP .
Jakiro is a fairly easy support to get decent farm with , it 's surprising at how low it is . It depends on how greedy your line up is of course .
OP 's already pretty much described his playstyle as hard 5 . and he 's 4 . 5k so clearly it 's not a terrible way to play jakiro .
I usually get most of my farm as Jakiro by solo pushing . It 's pretty risky later in the game so make sure you have some sort of way to get out . In that MMR range , most people wo nt be paying attention to what you re doing if you re not near them so you ll be able to sneak in some farm this way .
the funny truth
If you can win with jakiro without farm why would you want to lose with CM with farm ?
is my Dotabuff to my recent Jakiro games .
Or maybe a Linkens . They have some nasty / annoying single target spells .
I can see you re in very high skill , and you seem to be doing fine . Do nt worry about farming . At least , not trying to get some high gpm . Making space and pushing is more than your team can ask for .
It 's in the 4 . 5k bracket , and yeah GPM means nothing to a support , as long as I m warding the important areas and making sure the enemy has no vision in our important areas , it 's all good .

Here is your summary :



,
you should farm a lot more tbh
I m not taking these opportunities , I m taking other ones . Instead of farming , I spend the time doing more useful stuff since I do nt need the gold on the hero .
They do have a point though . I play lich , who tends to need gold a bit more , but even so the jungle is a good source of income for all supports when carries are nt utilizing it and other objectives are nt available .
People here are fucking retards .
They dont understand that even at 4 . 5k , you have multi - cores lineups and in a ganking meta , its a fucking stupid idea to risk yourself to farm or take the safe farm from the carries instead of stacking like a competent support .
Yes a 4k networth supports deals more than a 2k networth but a 10k networth carry + 2k networth support is better than your 4k nw support + 8k nw support .
You gank or counter gank as a support in this meta , even as a farming support . You can shoot nukes in waves sometimes but rarely .
Because hitting creeps wins the game right ? Kappa
[ deleted ]
do you know hes playing a pub ? and he is nt ppd ? ppd usually play defensive supports
jakiro is nt a defensive support , he can always have a tp to counter gank , jakiro is a 4 or 3 , dual offlane with jakiro are pretty good , and he can farm .
Boots and some mana regen is almost all you need as jakiro
lol dude u so bad
I thought Jakiro was one of the better farming supports ?
You re doing something wrong if your Jakiro is nt good at farming .
Jakiro is nt that bad at farming .
Jakiro is nt , the player is .
Maybe , but theres more important stuff to do in this meta .
Its actually a good farming amount for a support in this ganking meta .
lmao

Hard to win if mushi does not play . ADTR is not up to par sadly . Maybe if winter stand in , it would be good match in draft sense .




























no

Aghanim 's Scepter :
( New ability )
Thank you for taking the time to read my suggestion . The numbers can be tweaked for balance purposes . I strongly believe with this change , PL can be harder to play and can confuse new players .
Why ca nt we create illusions of buildings , you know .
That would be OP .
nope
BTW , this benefits team which often picks Alch , cause I can only see Alch giving him aghs rather than him getting it himself .
Which ones ? 3 of his abilities create illusions and 1 of them is passive . So 7 , 10 and 0 seconds .
this is literally the most overpowered fucking thing I ve seen in a long time
and , seriously , free 200 % damage with a massive uptime ? AND giving PL a fucking 1 sec stun with a 4 sec cooldown ?
Lmao
save us mr lizard




























Vengeful spirit can buy a second aghs allowing her to channel the power of the universe and swap her teams sides from dire to radiant or vice versa




























Anyone else disappointed by the new channel system ? It 's been a while now and I ca nt say I am happy with the new system . Sure , it technically brings more people together , since it automatically makes you join the channel of your region , but that does not necessarily make it more active .
It may sound stupid , but it 's kinda doing the opposite of what it is supposed to which is bringing people together .




























With all the shuffles and jumping around in Team Empire , there is a thing which i have noticed . Empire was initially a mixed squad of Russians and Ukrainians , but post TI5 and majors shuffles there is a thing which i have noticed . It is that 4 / 5 players are Ukrainians now .
You watch too much Russian TV .

Well you could place a ward in the spot and maybe a sentry to detect enemy ward .
Why the cogs at the end ? Is it to stop him from looking for a path again once he 's walked to the top ?

I like seeing so much Ursa ! He 's a beast !
Puppey talked about the doom counter it 's ursa with basher .




























I have been looking at making an autoexec file to put things like changing mini map sizes and other things but every time I try to make the file it does nt work . If anyone has a helpful link or just can explain it I would really appreciate it .
use Notepad + to make it and save as cfg
alright , where do I save it to ? The other times I tried to do this it wanted me to save it in a specific file which I could nt find any where
You need to go to your steamapps \ common \ dota 2 beta \ dota \ cfg folder and create a new file called autoexec . cfg . Edit the cfg file using Notepad + and save 1 code per line .
thanks
for some reason I only have the option of saving as a . txt using notepad , what am I doing wrong ?
its not notepad btw its notepad + u need to download it . also you have to save it as autoexec . cfg and make sure it does nt save itself as autoexec . cfg . txt . if it does , change the file type to cfg or all files
alright , thanks again




























Cheers buddy . So I take it I ca nt parse chat history for a single player if I do not have that player 's login details ?

Obvious boosting is obvious :
It was obviously boosted yes .
lol what a waste , he only played in unranked match which only in normal skill .
there is ranked game from two days ago that is normal skill too
probably party ranked ?
He 's probably done it to brag about his mmr in unranked games . Month or so ago my smurf ran into someone who was almost 6k in unranked and I was little confused , right up until he got crushed mid and started feeding nonstop because " it 's only unranked guys " No idea what the actual avg mmr of this game was ( because it was unranked ) but it ca nt have been much higher than 4k max

We need a custom for all the new amazing ags ideas .




























Same here . Used to get 40 - 50 on the SEA server . Now 200 + Very irritating .





























SEA server ? 90 % maximum
Very very high winrate . They d pick heroes that can carry games by themselves , and it would matter what their team did almost 100 % of the time .
Maybe not 100 % more from abandons than anything else , however I d say it d be around 90 - 95 ~
just think of it as you play alone in a bot match , your bot fed but it does nt matter as you owned too hard .

Treants contribute to like 60 % of the cs though .
Fng , God , and Silent all set alltime cs records on their respective heros , Fng more than doubling the previous record ( 308 by Fear )
This is expected against a Bulldog

It 's not that impressive considering he was basically pushing top against treants and shit for like half the game .




























Because why the fuck not .
WTF Rune : for 30 secs , you have no cooldown nor wastes mana .
plot twist : you ca nt bottle the aghanim 's rune or the WTF rune .
With wtf on , spamming scream is more dps .
blink dagger , force staff , any mobility ability .
mirana .
this is an amazing idea . so amazing that its never going to happen . but hopefully someone can make a custom game with this .
Also perhaps , the aghanim 's rune spawns only once or twice in a game . a mini - roshan of sorts . Kreygasm
Is this a shitpost ?
Aghanim 's Rune should refresh all spells and give the upgrade for 30 secs .
You know we ve reached critical mass when we ca nt tell anymore .
lol
Its gotta be . this is one of the most stupid suggestions i ve ever seen on this sub .
It would be funny if this were implemented , and meepo got meepo before he got aghs meepo
it would be a nice alternative to the double damage for caster hero 's like storm or timber , or lesh .
I thought it was giving Aghanim to the Rune .
I come here after read

This bucket also reveals invisible heroes for 3 . 5 seconds if they are targeted with the bucket . Once applied , a hero cannot be revealed from invis with a bucket for 10 seconds .
Thank you for taking time to read my suggestion
You re high dude .
does this buff my aghs tho
The real hard hitting questions
Right ?

will it work with treant protector or treants ?
Yes it spawns another treant when u water him . Kappa
would nt he know that already
Actually this should be Brewmaster Aghs upgrade because how would he be able to brew some brew without water ?
useful to block juke spots
Riktionary .
If in the inventory of a Riki who is in your inventory , Riki does nt take space because he has space in the bucket .
item is built from cheese + mango , but if the cheese is from a rosh killed by the enemy team it builds a dark bucket instead .
Once you fill a dark bucket , it is never empty , always cold .

Relatively new player , I love to hear about stuff like this , can anyone elaborate on what the suggestion was / what happened ?
from what i heard :
a long time ago , someone suggested the Bottle as a item . You could use it to restore health , mana and capture runes !
You re crazy , the community replied . It 's a terrible idea .
Well the developers thought it was interesting and added it . Now it has become an important aspect of the game !
Correction : a developer . No " s " It 's just Icefrog , although he does consider feedback from lots and lots of people , as well as data .
That 's actually not true , bottle is from the Guinsoo era in early 2006 . Guinsoo was still main developer in early 2006 .
Bottle was introduced around 6 . 30 , around the time that spec was broken as shit .
Also early 2006 times were still Icefrog 's time . I know this because I started playing dota in early 2016 .
Okay sounds legit .
good point ! i was nt sure if this was when it was just icefrog or when it was still some combination of the original ones .
As was puck . Although I think that a contest somewhere .
AFAIK runes always filled the bottle , but bottle crowing stopped because of the bounty rune meaning a guaranteed refill instead of a 50 / 50 , and crowing was directly nerfed by making the courier slower when holding a [ n empty ? bottle .
Plus do nt forget the speed boost nerfs . Used to be a 20 second max speed on a 40 second cd so you could just crow and empty bottle with that .
IIRC the very first version in Dota1 where bottle was introduced you could only replenish it near fountain . But that lasted like several days at most .
Bottle crowing is still very common . Almost required in most 6k + games to win a mid match - up .
This was back in the days of Dota1 and initially it was called an Empty Bottle , so roughly around > 8 years ago . God I feel old .
I agree it 's pretty weird , but not more than pocket Riki imo
It 's going to take a few more months of no patches before we reach pocket Riki level posts .
OP is trying to prove you wrong . We re closer than you think .
But . this patch is less than ten weeks old . And the devs explicitly told us another is coming in a couple more .
you re underestimating us
To this day , the best shitpost ever created

It refers to this thread : and here 's an artwork for it :
Lmfao this is amazing , thanks .
Basically someone suggested aghs riki wherein he could become an item and fit inside your " pocket " item slot . Someone send this guy the original post link im too tired sorry .
I mean a simple " wrong " would ve done just fine .
Could it be used on Morphling so you could put morph in your inventory ?
Can we sell him like Riki aghs ?
Upvoted for making others have some laugh too .
WAT
We TF2 now
*
Yeah but how do you target an invisible hero
Can confirm , got kicked from Valve server due to " cheats "
We have to give anything to nerf Doom a try . I mean its not like we can reduce his armor anymore .
Make him start with negative armor .
Definitely not enough exceptions or weird interactions to be considered for DotA .
There 's plenty of weird interactions , you just have to ask about them in the weekly stupid questions thread !
And if kotl targets himself with the empty bucket while near a female hero it fills with a white liquid .
Liquid light .
I have an item idea too .
You gotta post that in an extra thread .
Triggered .
| pause please - pizza .
Perfect . Great synergy with Riki in your inventory as well .
good shitpost mate real funny see you at FUCK YOUJ
Who in hell is Tjin by the way ?
It 's officially shitposting season .
Buy this on oracle to confuse your enemies even more and give them an aneurysm .
" WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU ,
we pocket riki now
No it gives you a pocket morphling
Two weeks of this .
My body is ready !
If i have an aghs riki in my inventory and the bucket is empty - can i put him in the bucket and dump him on other players ?
this sounds more like mario party than dota . Those mechanics are a reason I quit LoL
today is officially shitpost day
What a time to be alive .
But can I wear it as a hat ?
WTF did I just read ?
This rivals the Riki post . I never thought there could be a shitpost of this quality . God save us all .
SHITPOSTING BEFORE 6 . 86 CONTINUES
I d buy it
Most importantly , can the bucket be used to carry our Agh 's Riki around ?
best part
i also suggest being able to refill the bucket from morphling
that means morph 's autoattacks already do the same thing as what this suggested item is supposed to do xD
Is this the next Riki Aghanim 's ?
If 90 % of the sub is going to be shit like this , can we at least get a no shitpost filter ?
shitposting detected
high af
I think adding river mechanics could be very interesting if executed well . And would indirectly buff roaming heroes like venge / mirana / riki / bounty
Pre - patch shitposting in full force .
Way too complex .
fuck it , do it
Roshan seems at an all time low with a very less KDA . This might give him the buff needed to become viable again .
Seriously what the hell is up with all the stupid ass shit posts today .
shitpost / 10
weak dispel strong dispel dispel dispel normal dispel
weak dispel works except when this happens and this strong dispel always works except with this ability because i dont know how to balance game otherwise
Shitposting aside , I think a weird item like this would be fun , and not too broken . Valve please add .
We still have at least 15 more days of this hell . God Help Us All
tbh seeing the river being utilized in some way would be pretty nice . A movement speed buff for example would nt be bad .
Good concept . I just hate the hero - specific buff / de - buff idea . Still shitpost .
Gives more range to Tiny with aghs lol
another week or so of this shit
Not sure if shitpost , but I actually like this idea .
I was following you up to this sentence . Now I do nt know what to think .
Sounds like a core item for Morphling and the buff he truly needs .
volvo plz
this is fucking retarded holy dicks
Quite many uses for an item that only costs 900 gold .
Why do nt we just giff Riki an aghs
This is already in dota ?
I love it !

I think if it had one clear use itd be better maybe if it filled up from the river and if poured on an ally instantly restores like 150 / 250 HP . I mean mango gives a burst of mana maybe a HP burst item would be cool . Furthermore the item could give passive mana regen to compliment support players which would pick up the item . Like the mango after like 3 uses or 1 then it destroys . This could be a really clutch item as early on itd be like a wand with 7 charges without the mana burst instantly .
pls mr lizard
6 . 86 incoming when quality shitposts pop up .
No lore , 9 / 10
I guess this is the point that I leave , until the next patch .
everyone enjoy the next 2 weeks of shitposting !
7 . 8 / 10 too much water
nice bait

,
900 gold for a utility item that does at least 9 different things .
Who 's Tjin though ? Is that someone from dota 2 lore ?
This shit is so bad it 's actually good .
Yea how about some fucking Ice bucket challenge too ?
Comedy tag pls
oh , and only the Radiant can buy this .
This is a really unique item idea , hope it 's added !

It blows my mind no one ever mentions this .
You must be new to internet arguing , here 's a tutorial :
That 's it
3 . whenever someone claims you re at fault , he 's wrong . You should always blame someone else .
Yeah , no

It blows my mind that you re stupid enough to not realize people are talking about the quality of the games and not the fact that they lose more because you have ruiners / feeders / russians / party in your team .
It blows my mind you tell lies on the internet .




























To me it looks like you went a bit much into farming . While I get why you would go Mjollnir for the extra attack speed while you are already farming fast with Radiance , I believe that a Moonshard would have been more useful . Either that or more of a damage item such as basher . I personally do nt think that the best way to build Alchemist is the radiance build ( depending what type of team your are against ) I believe that the better Alchemist build ( for at least the rest of 6 . 85 ) is , This is not the official build , but you can watch his Alchemist games from Frankfurt if you want to try to understand the build the way that he created it .
Looks alright . A bit greedy to go radiance , but it 's not terrible
Huskar
Depends what you re facing and who 's in your lineup .
I have nt watched the game but maybe you need to learn when to fight with your team ? You had bots and such little impact .
I personally think the battle alch build is better ( solar blink AC etc ) but if you are going to run the radiance build , I think you have to commit and buy an octarine too .

Moving forward :
I dont wanna talk about neutral spawns - its common thing that Radiant has huge advantage because of that .
But lets talk about ancients :
Not to mention Radiant middle High ground advantage , whilst you can freely move around on Dire High ground , you cant take 2 steps on Radiants without being in tower range .
What do you mean by that ?
See for yourself
Radiant :
Dire : Dire not completely accurate , its actually smaller than that towards the top )
Basically , if you re ganking Dire 's mid there 's more area for you to stand safely , whereas on Radiant the tower range basically covers all of the uphill area the mid laner will stand , and is harder to gank .
Okay I will add this in 15 mins , I knew that thing .
Edit : actually this thing works only during night .
? What does
Imo both sides have pros and cons . Rosh pit is easier to get in and out of as Dire and the secret shop is closer .
Have a look at winrates for radiant vs dire . there is a clear bias ( ever single hero in the game has a better radiant winrate )
My win rate is 7 % higher when I m on the dire team .
























































so many unplayed heroes holy shit .
yea , but then misery is nt kicked




























Reduces the manacost of Ball Lightning from 30 + 8 % of max mana upon activation and 12 + 0 . 7 % of max mana per 100 units to 15 + 4 % of max mana upon activation and 6 + 35 % of max mana per 100 units .
Adding an aghs upgrade like this is pointless if it 's a direct upgrade to a skill , There is no reason not to build it if it directly makes your hero stronger it limits item builds . Aghs should only really be situational for cores
Cores like Lina and Meepo . Oh wait .
Venomancer and QoP as well .
Is this a meme now to just randomly post agh scepter ideas every day ?
If you had the option of that aghas and considering the bloodstone nerf would you not get it early ?
It depends on the game . Bloodstone is a snowball item ; if you have a Tusk / Spirit Breaker on your team , then you will likely be doing a lot of ganking and as a result get a lot of Bloodstone charges . On the other hand , if the enemy team has Silencer / Anti - Mage , then you will likely die a lot and have a hard time maintaining your charges . In the first scenario , Bloodstone gives a huge return on investment . In the second , however , it ends up being a waste of gold . That is when you buy Aghs instead .
Thats a really boring aghs .
Why not the ability to replace the last remnant he places ?
Because sometimes , boring but useful is better than creative but worthless .
The point of this upgrade it to give Storm a less risky alternative to Bloodstone . Bloodstone still has the potential to give far more mana if Storm can snowball , but Aghs is a safer choice if you feel that you wo nt be getting many charges or are afraid that you will die frequently and lose them .
High Risk / High Reward ( Bloodstone ) vs . Low Risk / Low Reward ( Aghanim 's Sceptre )
I did nt say they did nt exist . Look at the most recent aghs additions in , Every . Single . One . Every single one adds an interesting mechanic to change up the game . I completely agree with the direction he is taking the game . Agh 's should nt be a stat alternative , it should drastically change some aspect of the hero beyond basic numbers .
Anyways : ur thread / idea never made it to the front page . Its in the dumpster along with the other thousands of garbage aghs suggestions I see on this subreddit . Feel free to argue your painfully dull upgrade to Icefrog himself . I m sure he ll see this thread and think : Wow ! I never thought to buff the stats on storm 's ult as an aghs ! Thank god for the reddit think tank !
1 ) You said " there are so few aghs that just buff stats on the ability " I listed 20 ( and I probably missed a few )
2 ) Aghs does nt have to be " interesting " or " change up the game " to be a good upgrade .
a dipshit .

dota has a lot of numbers and shit like a lot and idk a lot of em .
for you personally , have you learned a lot of your dota knowledge from research or just from playing for hours and hours ?
P . S . And by research I do nt mean just reading stuff but also watch some replays / streams / videos .
Both of them
both
Playing improved my mechanical skills . Watching pros improves my decision making and item choices




























I have 0 . 99 support and 0 . 99 versatility so no way , I do nt spam
What ? No way , I should always pick a different support for 20 games to get the 0 . 99 versatility , I totally do nt spam any hero .

Not 100 % hero spam but 12 of my last 20 games are with SF , 5 with Puck , 2 with Ember and 1 with Storm .
this might be the only legit spam . Most people here have a relatively good versatility . I spam venomancer and i got 0 . 03 in versatility
0 . 00 versatility FTW , I do nt like how much support it shows though , I think hero healing via bottle & mek counts towards it .
I have no idea what makes you people want to spam heroes . I ve only ever played the same hero twice if I REALLY felt like playing that hero and the first game had an abandon .
I ll post mine in a few minutes .
EDIT : The edited part is the hero I spam .
Ebola spirit
It 's Crystal Maiden .
what ? how do you have that much push with cm ? is nt push = tower damage done ?
I play other heros tbh , so the graph might be a bit off .

It was crap . Spent so much money , and i would always get the bronze tier crap all the time . I get that bronze is the most common , but c mon .

that 's not only with the compendium
I got 2 gold , 4 silver and a lot of tide purple thing .

damn , this shit again ?
its ok bby , patch will come soon enough .

Dota 2 is still gucci tho .

When you clicked a unit many times it said different lines , they got annoyed that you kept bothering them and would complain about it . When you clicked 10 times or something that is the line pit lord would say .
It 's already a thing in DotA 2 , click your hero 5 times and they say one of their rare lines . Not sure if every hero has this , but the large majority should
YouTube is a website where people upload videos they make on a wide range of topics .
dota 2 voice work is pretty amazing as well , tho .
Yeah juking and cutting trees for juking was a much bigger thing .
yes , we get it , the end game screen is better .
also , have you heard the great new suggestion ? alt - ping on items with charges should display the charges
Who cares anyway ? Except OP that is .
I agree , having Pitlord makes Dota 1 better Kappa
! votekick
If I remember correctly this was a lobby feature only and never in game . As an in game feature would be pretty cool though lol . Had this guy feed 3x + in a row last night because he gave first blood getting bounty and would have loved to vote kick him .
Was really expecting a picture of Slardar
Aghanim 's Scepter gave some heroes special effects . those were cool . I guess they do nt wanna do it anymore because of cosmetics .
We have Russians in Dota 2 as well .
I will study all of this data after each game to improve my play .


Volvo giff auras please
The technology is nt there yet kappa
They re trying to create a larger community , not destroy the one we currently have . It 's really hard , because we all know those kinds of players exist , the ones that will flame you for 40 minutes , and then pour on even more hate when these kinds of stats are shown at the end of the game . I mean hell , I ve gotten flame for low gpm before . So the question is really a matter of how to best expand the end game statistics without putting the individuals at higher risk for reports / flame . I do nt believe they would simply transfer that same stat page over ; it d be chaos .
I highly doubt that , would ever case .
There 's a reason MMR was hidden for so long after all .
The reason MMR was hidden was because people would flame you at the start of the game or the pick screen , showing stats after the end of the game is nothing like that .
But it 's really unlikely that people wo nt disconnect after the game ends just to flame you . And even if they do , you can just leave it yourself .
What people can do and know they should do is often not the same as what they end up doing
theres no conflict , the games already over .
The only issue is this is NOT a new thing , this was already tested , implemented and worked for years in dota1 . Why would it suddenly have different behavior ( same with mmr )
im not assuming , I was a part of that community for years , I dont even get how can you draw such conclusions
People will find ways to be dicks anyways , by having these stats the flame becomes a bit more constructive at least .
Valve is trying to avoid giving them an excuse or something to latch onto
This still means the user is flamed and his experience has been harmed
I think this is a very fair case for not doing it . People would use it for find more reasons to blame their team for their loss than anything else .
Same reason why they probably do nt let you alt - click allied spells and items .
This sounds like really stupid reasoning to me . At the end of the game you can just leave , you have already spent 40 minutes with the flamer how is 30 seconds at the end game screen going to be the thing that turns you away from the game . As you said a flamer will already find things to flame for like gpm so not adding in a better end game screen for flame reasons is just dumb .
But it 's better to give examples :
all that other info used to be available during or before the match though , big difference .
That is certainly not the reason , ragers find a way to rage no matter what , does nt matter about the facts lol
thats silly , you only see it at the end of game , theres no opportunity for flaming at that point .
. We know they re working on the UI . We do nt know anything else .
it does but you need plus
hence why valve should implement this feature , instead of letting 3rd party companies charge for it
Interesting , I ll definitely check it out , I m just used to going straight to dotabuff I guess .

Ranged desolator projectile and sound was better .
Pit lord ?
I miss the mirana back arrow
Lol , if only that was the only thing working better in Dota than in Dota 2 .
thought this was going to be a pic of slardar
Ah the ol ' BoT AC Battlefury 3 Rapier Pitlord build , yes .
- so too
it even showed how many times you died to X hero and killed X hero
Lone Druid .
are nt they working on this when they fuck about with the in - game UI ?
and Random Draft mode
ban lists
show fucking hero and tower dmg so i can flame the shitstains in my games who have no impact on cores
He meant Pitlord obviously .
Source 3 will fix it
fog of war was so much better in dota 1 .
swap 3 8
The graphics
Swap in SD
Russian infestation started way before I thought it did
im expecting slardar
Bots are better in Dota 1 I think
I miss having access to the - aa and - ha commands which used to show you your arrow accuracy as mirana and your hook accuracy as pudge respectively .
More = better
How often will this get posted ?
At least , that 's what the word choice would imply in the title .
The dota1 end screen does have much more information .
Graphics was better , sounds was waaay better
We have websites which contain all this data and more , hardly better .
Also there is nt much that screen tells me i do nt already know , i mean i was playing the game .
you were playing your game , not the other 9 players .
Really sick of these posts . Could we get some content on this subreddit ?
be the change you wish to see .




























Today I would like to dissect the core components of 3 items that I mentioned in the title , being
So lets start with MKB .

Suggested change

Overall , a nerf to mini - bash damage , price increase , but more attack speed ( 5 ) Note that the damage from all components add up to 87 , but to keep it from being changed to much and the effort to get it , I kept it at 88 . 1 for effort .

Basically , float like a butterfly . With that in mind , I did not want to take away the flair of the item , so before I move on with my remake / rework of Butterfly , I suggest in an overhaul behind the concept .
Hence I will go in straight to my item suggestion namely

So here is my suggestion for the new Butterfly :

Anyway , pretty long ass post . I hope you guys wont jump to conclusions and think this is a shitpost ( sorry if you guys end up feeling it still is )
SeemsGood
At this point in Dota evasion is very strong and we need another way to deal with it in addition to MKB , on the other hand MKB is a very powerful item . Any changes to evasion will also affect PA very much , and she needs a buff . I m curious what Icefrog will do .
I dont agree with the mkb one , If solar crest wasnt created , I think most players would prefer Daedalus .
I do agree that Butterfly seems so bad . A skadi is far more superior
I think you could just reduce the damage of MKB so that it 's not an amazing damage item even if they do nt have any evasion on the enemy team .
As for Yasha , I m not sure what the item needs .




























Relocate has global range . I think you mean Tether .

,
you can relocate at pretty much max tether cast range if you time it right , what is the issue here ?




























i liked your video ,
so you are 12 y / o faggot . your video is shit .
So . How does a " video " makes me a 12 y / o faggot ? If you are assuming that I was trolling then you are wrong , someone submitted this for me and I made the vid . Edit : I can see from your comment karma that you are a piece of shit . May god have mercy on your poor lost soul .
if you just created the video - it 's still shit .
Meh , that 's your opinion so keep it to yourself




























So first people complain that they ca nt win because a stack is on their team , now they complain because a stack is on the opposing team .
There is no such thing as solo queue kid .
Wait what ?
Ok this is fucking stupid , this should nt happen
Nice feed
























































If you look at the item guides in game , there 's always one that 's Valve made called " Suggested items " for every hero .
That 's the one I edited for every hero that I play often , and I just put the most common items for each specific hero , just so it was easier to shift click into my quick buy . That way I did nt have to type the item name to search for it . And after saving it , it lasted for around a year .
But recently , I just noticed that it got reset for every hero . Did that happen to anyone else ?
i cant even use them , i save items and next game its all default .




























front page of reddit .




























Vega are pretty damn good , as are VP .
The EU scene is just really damn close right now .
how vega beat secret was surprising not that they did it imo . vega is a very strong team but they just stomped secret in both games xD
Vega had nothing to play for in the games vs Mvp phoenix . They were already qualified for DreamHack Moscow .
OG won dreamhack though
[ removed ]
Yeah they were no Aliiance or Na vi that 's for sure .
Honestly this was my first thought . They know the patch is dropping soon so they are trying to get ready for it and expand their hero pools before they get nerfed .
Yeah it 's actually pointless to continue coming up with strategies and trying to make them work until the patch hits , it would just be a waste of time and effort . Pro dota is somewhat meaningless until then .

Bots are never perfect .
Its almost as if you win some games and lose some games in dota all the time and no one team will always win everything
Except this guy . He does nt lose :

Really nothing more to it , the patch is dropping soon anyway so this is just garbage time atm .
Unbelievable how no one still gets it . They are human beings and do nt tryhard 24 / 7 . You judge teams by their results at the last major tournament and overall trends , not specific bo3 where your favourite team managed to win
I dunno , having your carry play from NA to EU is annoying I suppose . And yeah , the 6 . 85 patch is obsolete at this point , so they are probably just fucking around until the next version comes out .
well , new patch / meta coming in 2 weeks . probably you can find some good reasons there .
I believe it 's only because OG and Secret strats are already known to them . Like you must ban ember vs secret
fallout 4
EE can only play ember thats why Secret kept on losing
Probably playing fallout 4
fallout 4
Both OG and Secret have players with high ping . I would nt take online results too seriously .
Instead of giving vega and vp the respect they deserve for winning fairly ppl like you keep giving bs reasons and refuse to believe the truth , that both teams played really well and deserved the win .
I am a secret fan too but I still have not lost my ability to reason .

i saw a thread saying that it would likely be 15 or more dollars too

After bottle / treads / aquila / wand , SF generally builds one of the following
Blink ? I dont ever see the purpose . I guess its a snowball item , if you really get ahead , you can continue to chase and pressure enemies with sf 's natural high DPS . But I cannot think of a single situation where its really beneficial . When should SF build this ?
S & Y ? I have no idea and never see the purpose . I think it is always outclassed by skadi . Is it niche ?
I really appreciate any feedback / references to more guides / videos I can watch :
That 's your problem . Shadow blade can be good on SF , but only situationally . Only pick it up if A . they have heroes that have weak escapes , B . they are nt 5 manning , C . you are doing well early and D . You do nt have any invis on your team and they do nt have any natural true sight . OR they have a hero silver edge counters . Either way , it should definitely not be your usual pickup above 2k bracket .
If you went Eul 's , you usually want blink . Even if you did nt , get it if you have a hero like Earthshaker , Magnus , Tide , etc . For obvious reasons , makes for some sick plays .
It 's the best farming item on SF . Gives you mana and movespeed . You can raze the jungle out in no time . Also , it 's the only way to reliably get solo kills on SF . Get it if you want to play greedy but still be able to get pick offs and not be super vulnerable to ganks .
It gives you everything you need on SF in terms of early game right click . Better late game than any other options . It 's much better in the early game than Skadi , gives you MS , cheaper , better build up . Also , it 's not one or the other , SnY + Skadi is very strong . Skadi first is trash . lmao niche ? It 's basically the standard on SF these days .
I would nt go skadi first , but I felt like going skadi after sand and yasha basically wastes 4k . But thats very interesting . Do pros still go blink / euls ? and if one does go blink / euls , can they still afford a BKB or does that hurt the slots for DPS items ? A comment above mentioned that euls is super reliable for pickoffs , especially on escape heros . So when would you recommend getting SnY ?
SnY is basically the default , it 's pretty much always good but never great . Get it unless one of the other items seems especially strong , how often this is depends on your playstyle .
You still go BKB unless you really do nt need it . Yes it does hurt your slots , but in the late game you can always just sell them , and blink euls can fuel your farm so much it does nt even matter .
giff ur dotabuff and ppl will help
All you need to know is get a minimum of 70 cs at 10 and ur golden
Yeah that is nt a problem , especially on Radiant . I just need to know how to spend it .
To answer your questions :
Just a little food for thought .
You are not 5k MMR for a reason !
What do you suggest for learning more ? I m a uni student and generally play with my team . So its a different playstyle then solo queing . It is my fault thought I have to admit
I m not from le reddit army , I m sorry that you do nt see it as constructive . Let me try to explain .
You talk about getting frustrated with random teammates . This should never happen in the first place . Do nt let it get to you .
Hope this helped you a bit . If not I m honestly sorry , but I tried .
Also , thank you for not freaking out at my response , you give me hope in humanity .

Has this happened to anyone else ? volvo plz fix party chat !
Scientists = baffled




























Hi at all I have some problem since the last days . Sometimes dota freeze for 2 - 3 seconds , it can happen in every moment , it can happen when simple walking and nothing bad but it happened twice in teamfight and I died badly simple because I was just standing still .
Thanks for the help .
The power of the computer is nt the problem , but that does nt mean there is nt an issue with your components / drivers / etc .
do you get an error message regarding display drivers failing and being recovered ? because it sounds a lot like that to me .

Thanks for the answer .
I will try this as soon I can .
Thanks for the help , I really appreciated it .
Is steam disabled from your antivirus ?
No , it is nt
Well thanks anyway for the help

OP on slardar he is already first picked on a lot of teams it makes desolator useless
Bane is one of the best early game supports being able to enfeeble a tower and dive early game is really strong

Navi is front !
except that OG already dumpstered Alliance in Starladder
Non redditors would have said rock , paper , scissors
Just want to make it clear , no need to start being mad
My flair says it all
KURO WAS RIGHT RTZ WAS LEFT AND ALLIANCE IS BACK
But who is front ?
Navi is front because they are not back
All i now is that puppey is left right and , and making things happen .
Puppey
But Navi was supposed to be back BibleThump
They won both games without S4 ?
S4 came back for the second game .
They have been to the dumpster and back and back to the dumpster and back !
right after they roflstomp d OG ? A ] TI6 win incoming Kappa
The Na Vi vs OG series was pretty close , definitely would nt call it a stomp . And OG immediately after 2 - 0 d Alliance .
Hence Alliance is the best team in the world atm .
navi is back - to the dumpster
OD confirmed for being Starladder Kappa
For the day at least .
'cause they won against one of the most shitty teams in the scene ? yeah right theyre back
OG is a weird team though , they have a hard time against bad teams but are able to beat the best ones . It did nt exactly stomp their way through the major .

Alchemist is the one time getting it / stopping him from getting it might be worth giving up first blood .
but its fun
Ofc it is , you get 5 times more gold and exp than they do from that kill . If you are in offlane it ll win your lane automatically .




























dont tell me courier feeding is some advanced dota psychologist strategy .
But without a speed limit they ll just be able to get the couriers out even faster .
If people want to throw the game they will always find a way to do so , stopping courier feeding will just encourage them to find something else .
Just report them and hope they go rot in low prio .
You can buy like 30 cour before is has " this hero ca nt buy more cour " Why is nt that number like 5 max .




























Starladder :
7 heroes - 3 games :
wow did nt notice that .
What ?
Actually 8 . So OG only picked 8 heroes in the 3 games
Ded patch
oh boy its already starting
OK , this is the chosen thread it looks like .
secret also loses to CIS . It seems CIS teams are the strongest during winter . just like how vp polar and empire was last year .

Thanks mates
But CIS teams ai nt their weakness !

Is that why they lost twice to Vega in the majors ?
It 's so weird seeing the two carries on VP top the net worth charts .
It definitely worked a lot better . Not having the entire weight of the world on G was a good change
No venge 5th in net worth hype .
Someone does nt remember 6 . 82 / 6 . 83 VP .
Two : highest pro GPM on Anti - Mage and most last hits in a pro game .
CIS confirmed to be OG kryptonite
Can people just realize that the European scene is extremely competitive with a lot of teams very close in skill right now ?
subtle
I think everyone has already realized this
It 's why EU should get more invites or CIS should be treated as a separate region for qualifiers for the majors . Take two slots away from NA for it , besides EG for competition and Unknown for fun they got nothing to offer anyway .
Silent 's gyro is the main reason why I like this roster more . And hg siege is much better now .
Are they almost out of the LAN ?
FNG WAS RIGHT
G IS MID

Have to agree . EG had two of their worst games of the tournament in their lower bracket final against OG , and Secret . frankly did nt look anything like the team they had been for the entire rest of the tournament .
I will say they were nt playing to the incredibly standard they were previously , but I think calling it " luck " is a bit of a stretch . You do nt just get consistently lucky against the best teams in the world . This is the team that has been in the winner 's final of every " major " tournament including and since TI4 , going on to win two of them .
Still I did expect them to perform better than they have ( and expect them to perform very well in the future ) they just have nt shown up yet . Really though they ve only played 2 tournaments , being eliminated by the overall winner in one and placing 3rd in another so it 's not like they ve been playing like shit or anything .
Good teams make other teams look bad . OG outdrafted and outplayed EG and Secret , please do nt make excuses for poor play .
to .
Little exaggeration but you get the point .
They re not the same people saying those things afaik .
Or maybe there are different people voicing their own opinions .
They obviously had to perform well to win the whole major but it 's also very possible that teams did nt know how or were nt prepared to play against them and thus underperformed .
I m not taking about people 's opinions , I m taking about the overall upvote / downvote trend . There 's going to be people on both sides regardless .
Not making any excuses - I m not sure where you get that from . I m saying that , had EG and Secret played to their normally top form , as they had for much of the tournament , I wonder if the outcome would have been different .
As it played out , of course , OG outplayed them both .
All I m saying is , should they meet again , I would at least favour EG to beat them in a rematch , regardless of recent results .
EG and OG have actually played 6 games ( They played a bo3 in MLG which OG also won )
Thanks , I stand corrected !
I think its simply bad drafting , when you look back to before the majors they would try to play the vision game and split push against CIS teams but going constant 5v5 against CIS teams is always very hard .
I do nt agree , I think OG are simply not taking these games as seriously , especially after winning two LANs and one as big as the major . They were definitely playing a lot more casually / clowny , when compared to their Major performances . I still think they re a tier 1 team , in the top 5 in the world .
yeah sure , taking seriously LAN with 100k prizepool and then taking far less seriously qualifiers to LAN with 300k prizepool

More like OG a patch team xD
THE , MAJOR CURSE CONTINUES
fuck this subreddit
Won the major , i said : Wow , EG & Secret played just 1 shitty game and now OG is the best ? Such an overrated team . I bet they are not gonna win anything again '
they already did .
Virtus pro is back PogChamp
Always blaming the jew .
Hitler confirmed .
We na vi now
Does the TI curse apply to majors as well ?
Did nt OG say something about CIS teams being their kryptonite ?
Very greedy drafts by OG I felt . And they doubled down on their greed despite it not really working for them . I think they got outdrafted and outplayed , but I do nt think they really played the signature style that won them Frankfurt either .
Illidan was left .
JUST MAYBE

Illidan probably would have throw .
And tbh it looks like Fly is just giving everyone their favourite hero before the release of the next patch
4Head
It must have been really hard to throw 2 games against Na Vi yesterday . at least VP is almost a good team , but OG still need awful drafts and awful play to lose .
It is a honeypot lan according to my programming sources .
OG 's 2 weeks of fame came to an end . They were lucky the majors was during that time .
Always fun to read your posts
exactly
OG has lost 5 out of their 5 last games , all of them were against russian teams .
Fly 's draft this entire second group stages has been nothing short of horrible .
But OG won when it mattered at least SeemsGood




























Reddit Aghanims :
Not enough




























Let me just give you an example to show you what I m getting at .
Undying .
I ve played him countless times and have over 100 wins with him . To put it simply , I m either tired of his ridiculously enforced core build or I feel like he just is nt getting the unique attention he deserves .
So then I looked at his item usage on dots buff , and the numbers do nt lie . You will be flamed in casual pubs if you do nt purchase mana boots or blade mail . And the player base is nt wrong , he faces mana issues early on and his ultimate requires him to be right at the center of a team fight .
But this hero is by far no one trick pony . And so I m starting to wonder what he 's really capable of . For instance , his Intelect stat progression is more influential than his strength progression , and he 's a strength hero . Well , let 's dig deeper into his potential .
Long story short to my idea .
Anything is possible in dots
If you are vs 4 or 5 melee , stack bfury on Ursa or Naix , great fun
my man ! bfury on naix , see ? that 's what I m talking about
then prove those assholes wrong
Nyx = Naix
I m sorry , but I have no idea what you re trying to say .
I understand the question . Good luck with the discussion .




























:
,
Who do they get to replace him ? Waga ?
Waga is :
I guess some1 from ex - NiP




























This is just an ad guys . Downvote , report , move on
wtf 30 $ for this ?
americans ? lol




























Also 1200 cs on viper .
Octarine + Refresher Treants = inflated CS
You re mad ?
Nah , it just feels like a shitty way of winning . Especially for a team that should be better than this .
Well , they won a TI by playing like that




























No particles broken in 90 minute game between Alliance - VP
well , it being 64 bit has something to do with it
no dark seer .




























It 's EE . Not sure what kotlguy is smoking
its ee 's smurf
hint : his steam pic is the same as his twitter and he tweeted yesterday after their loss to vega
Why is he using his smurf ? Just EE doing EE things ?
i think because of skins : D
Its a secret
I think its Envy . Envy tweeted " Just Let it All Out of You " just now which he only ever tweets before officials .
It 's EE , Kotlguy is a retard nothing new . He has even the same pic like on twitter
It 's Envy . I think I saw him using that username earlier ( and his twitter sort of confirms it .
Plus Envy plays Huskar a decent amount .
Why did Liquid not have a fifth ban in that game ?
They let the ban time ( and reserve time ) run out . If the team does nt select a ban then no hero is banned .
It 's EE .
Kick EE win TI , I think it worked out before
Pretty sure Envy came up with all the good ideas Alliance used to win TI3 and that is why they are still using them .




























THAT WAS SO * NET LEVEL

He controls the creep while the projectile is in the air and self denies .

MVP
Beesa , netting the carry .
What a heads up play .
Anyway , he would be fine even w / o netting Jugg , because Jugg had no omni , no basher , no slows , nothing to stop Sven from running away .




























Expected to see 1000 mmr . Was disappointed
congratulations are in order
Congratulations . You are improving !
nice man , i hope i had the courage to play ranked
Only 7 more years and you are at the average reddit rating . you can do it .
That 's some interesting name .
Good job man
Grats , The Trench is a hard place but it only makes us stronger !
Congrats ! I calibrated at around 1 . 5k at the beginning of 2015 and I made it to 3 . 5k in October !
Now I m steadily losing MMR and I will probably fall to 2k soon . I thought 1 and 2k mmr was hard . Now I can barely win any games .
Well that 's a rude way to put it .
Well shit , I was extremely tired when i wrote that , did nt mean for it to come across that way , sorry ,
i calibrated at 1 . 1k solo and 1 . 3k party when i had no idea about how to play dota .
i easily reached 2 . 5k but i dont play that much anymore .
but nice job man =
If you do nt play that much anymore then why are you here ? And more importantly , what 's up with that terrible attempt at a subtle humble - brag ?
lol how is 2 . 5k bragging
I do nt know . I could be wrong .
For sure .
Ehh , people are allowed to be on reddit and watch Dota w / o playing .
Le 2 . 5k brag lol
NOT bragging
Im NOT , its just easy to climb 1k mmr , thats all .
Depends on your skill level , and your starting point .




























Something like that




























dotabuff : there is some option on matchmaking or something ?

Alch has higher gpm than the entire radiant team combined .
Well he has gold coming from 3 players
that alch had 1 . 7k GPM . A carry farming nonstop would nt even get half that
Right they wont keep up but , they all have less than 100 cs in a 30 minute game . To me , it 's less about what alch is doing and more about how poorly the radiant is using the map .
Their farm is actually rather impressive by 3k standards . Most 3k carry pickers I meet are seriously impressed with themselves if they get 30 last hits per 10 minutes .
What server are you on ? I am 2 . 9k atm and most people are disappointed if they get 40 of less
I m 2 . 4k and sad if I m under 50 :
Perhaps they realized they cant keep up in terms of GPM with the enemy team . So they just all in and try to end asap .
Here is your summary :



,

me too thanks
Here is your summary :



,
1 . 7k gpm , jesus .
I even have a stupid video of LC doing similar stuff in ranked =

i played an lp game where everyone else was 1500 mmr below me . my mid fed 4x then dc , the other one didnt load in , and 2 retards , still a win .
MMR does nt say shit . Yes , the average 4k player will be better than the average 3k , the average 3k better than the average 2k , but that is about all it says . I have a 3k + account and a < 1k smurf , and sometimes I m more impressed with the people I meet on the smurf than the people I meet on my main . How do carry pickers who actually think that 40 - 50 last hits in 20 minutes is impressive even end up in the 3k - 4k bracket ?

See , it 's at least possible for Alch to have close to that at 30mins . I feel like the victory is more down to Ursa having blink + basher + satanic + mkb + travels at 28 mins .
i hate people that stay in a clearly unfair match after people abandon . you are nt good if you 3v5 , 2v5 or 1v5 when you literally have 3x the gold coming in as well as all their items being sold .
























































playing solo against a 3 . 6k party that has 5 . 4k mmr solo on a 4k avg game .

hello , any guides to play him ? I played him before and never played him again in a year ( I had 144 games with him or so )
should I level geo strike atleast once before maxing poof ? I like the slow )
Level geo at 6 or 8 and max earth bind after maxing poof .
stack , gank , farm , rotate to base with second meepo
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 etc then 6 for meepos 2 + 3 , 7 for meepos 4 + 5 , 8 for meepos 1 + 2 , 9 for meepos 3 + 4 , 0 for meepo illusions is what I do
Brown boots / treads / BoT - aghs - blink - diffu 2 / manta / hex / eblade / skadi ( and a combo of those after you have 1 ) you can also stack ulti orbs and transform them into other items later )
diffu 2 = pure damage item , extremely amazing agi per gold
hex = control
manta = meepos to confuse them , more splitpush , some damage but unreliable damage
skadi = to tank up
Analyzed a total of 100 matches . 52 wins ; 0 all pick , 100 ranked all pick , 0 single draft and 0 other . This bot attempts to analyze your last 100 games and averages out the stats .
,
Vlads is garbage , worse than an ulti orb and only useful when the meepos are around the main one .
Heart is garbage because you need damage not hp , if you want to tank up get skadi . If you watch any of the top meepos you will see none of them ever go heart ( maybe 1 of them will get it extremely rarely )
Well if you snowball out of control correctly his ulti will do nothing except piss you off for 2 seconds .
Decision wise you have some options too , stay back / splitpush the whole fight , he will be forced to not use ulti or use it one someone else - then you initiate . Or you jump on him at the start of the fight , or you kill their most important hero fast enough that echo slam does nt matter
Vlads is a waste of an item slot
watch lizzard stream , he plays imo best meepo , or w33 hes good also

done




























,
Damn that was very mature and professional but not in a PR - ish way too , much respect for Illidan and hope he enjoys his new team .
So professional . Hope he finds a good team asap
Okay , who am I kidding , maybe a qualification through some CARRY DAZZLE
Oh , Illidan , i see wide kind animu hero heart
I watched him on stream a lot lately , comes across as very mature .

VERY rough translation of comments from VP 's Manager :
Airat is one of the most experienced players in CIS and many times proved , that he is one the best carries . I sincerely hope that he will become an integral part of the team , and our results will be far better "
" After a relatively successful performance at TI5 , the roster became stagnant and the constant 5 / 6th place in tournaments became a stumbling block for the team .
Airat is one of the most experienced players in CIS and has proven many times to be one of the best carries . I sincerely hope that he will become an integral part of the team and our results will be far better .
NotLikeThis
I really hope Illidan finds a new team quickly , I m going to miss his carry silencer .
and to be replaced by Silent aswell , He 's a great player but at the moment i rate Illidan way above him
Pretty much how I felt after reading this thread .
Hope Illidan finds his new groove somewhere !
Would be a shame to let DR go though . He 's got huge potential .
Illidan is amazing , but he 's not the kind of carry Na vi needs .
I m probably just being sad cause illidan and the unconventional picks he d play were the reason why I rooted for VP in the first place . Hopefully he finds a good team to join .
Yea i agree . VP 's strats worked so well on so many occasions . And i do nt think Silent plays those heroes . Or if he does , i do nt think he can play them at Illidan 's level . And even on traditional carries , i still rank Illidan above Silent . Maybe Silent was more stable over his all career but in the past months he seemed to be in decline ( at least to me ) And Illidan improved a lot . Guess VP will have some new strats now . Hopefully we still get funky stuff . Hope they do well and that Illidan finds a strong team to compete with .
this is a good point but the more valuable player in a drow visage lineup is the visage player . drow is really straight forward whereas there are no other visage players like lil . lil can literally play everything . still surprising tho
well we all know vp kick illidan and he always comes back
lets just wait
just like how silent returns to empire .
i always thought he threw way to often .
And Illidan does nt throw ? D
It 's in every CIS carry 's blood to throw games .
They were not prepared
Rofl literally look at his team history

i tried to translate comments from vp 's manager in a comment below
hope it makes reasons behind change more clear
ye ur translation was pretty correct
im just saying how VP shuffles illidan
yeah , honestly , i wouldnt be surprised if in future they bring illidan back , because how many times this already happened ?
3 times if im not mistaken
As a VP fangay i do nt know how to feel about this . This was really surprising . Illidan was always exciting to watch and I think his playstyle really fits VP . Let 's just see how Silent does but I m a bit worried .
But I think Silent is better on playing midgame / fighting heroes like Slardar and letting God carry from mid some games , which is more meta now
I like Illidan and believe that he can outplay Silent on some heroes in some games , but Silent is just an overall more solid package for VP
Yup , Illidan was one of the best in the world in 6 . 82 / 6 . 83 IMO . Seriously , he had some outright insane games . Unfortunately the new meta does not favor him .
Silent is probably better at the moment , but he does nt have anywhere near Illidan 's flexibility and I doubt he ll have the same synergy .
Silent is 27 wtf
looks like 17 , ikr

He turns 28 tomorrow .
Holy fuck I finally share birthday with someone I admire .
I share birthday with Kuro .

thanks nahaz SeemsGood
Nahaz stats Kreygasm
Love these stat posts !
Nice stats ! Thank you
Hoping he can find a good team before the cut off , I think after the times he 's carried VP and the times he threw he deserves a decent team .
inb4 illidan joins a new team then 6 . 86 becomes slark meta .
Slark is already a pretty strong hero , the horror
Meh , not really . He 's middle of the pack at best .
But why ?
Not hyped about this one . Silent has been super inconsistent at LANs . Not saying Illidan was perfect , but he fit in nicely with VP .
I dunno , call me crazy but Silent 's consistency seems to purely vary on where Gyro sits in the meta as a core or not .
He is not performing great now and he had a lot of questionable plays during hohohaha patch .
From this day forth for eternity 6 . 83 shall be known only as " hohohaha patch "
Silent loves playing Luna too .
Source : Empire fangay
I do nt know about that , I probably need to watch a lot more Empire games .
In , Empire game I ve seen since and including TI ( not a lot of games mind you ) Silent has consistently been the weak link . He usually does great in the lane , and then he just seems to yolo dive into the enemy team and feeds .
I mean , I know only like 5 words in russian , and that 's one of them . Assuming everybody else is just like me , of course that 's how CIS dota goes .

Wat do pidor and zaebal mean ?
Honestly sounds like something Illidan would do too .
Are you talking about Silent or S4 ?
Are you sure we re watching the same silent ? This is coming from an ex - empire fan btw
He is very consistent until the most important part of the game , then he makes 1 stupid mistake and game is lost
The way I see it , is that VP decided that they needed to change something , since their run at the frankfurt majors got cut short .
It is obvious that this is somewhat risky but sometimes taking a risk like this is necessary . I see it in a somewhat similar light to when EG decided to pick up sumail , a very young player that they thought had the potential to become great and I think we can all agree that sumail has done pretty well so far . This is ofcourse not to say that silent will have the same amount of impact af sumail ( though I do hope ) but i think the concept works .
If make analogy with EG it is more like kicking Aui and getting rtz . Kicking player which was carrying team from " the shadow " and getting a well known carry .
A year ago I would say that it is a good move by VP as before TI5 I ve thought that Silent was top - 3 carry . Now I m not sure . I feel that Silent is not as good as he was and this transfer may break the team chemistry of VP .
Illidan will be back , as always .

What chemistry ? The team obviously has problems . Have you watched any of their recent games ? Even in the games they are leading if they dont close the game early its nearly impossible for them to win . They panic and choke and do weird moves even when they are ahead , some sort of mental block that tells them that they cant handle lategame .
You make it sound like that 's things that Empire , with Silent , do nt do .
Agree , Silent 's TI5 performance was really bad and he has nt shown that it was only a fluke with his recent performances . I feel like Silent right now is a downgrade , though not really that big of a downgrade . I d still value the chemistry and how Illidan has performed with VP 's system / playstyle .
Illidan needs a team that will let him safely get his items and do his own thing . VP on the other hand , need a " Notail " kind of a carry that will fight with them and still manage to be a factor when it 's needed .
Empire will be better with Xboct , VP might also be better with Silent seems like a Win Win , but ofcourse the loser is illidan who only has 5 - 6 days to find a new team .
. And Synderen ?
Idk what to say about VP , ever since G joined , Illidan never actually played AM , slark etc heroes , it 's like G is the 1 in that team and that Illidan was just there to support G or some shit .
What are you talking about . They still picked slark after G joined .
You just do nt see slark now because it 's not that great in the current meta . DS shits on slark . Doom shits on slark . Slark ca nt gank meta heroes like qop / ember . AA is pretty popular in the meta and it counters slark . Look , it was only picked 3 times at Frankfurt .

I have mixed feelings
From the one hand i think that silent is \ was underperforming in empire and i m glad xboct in .
From the other hand illidan was supporting G , but not carrying the games .
I wonder where Illidan would go ?
This transfer really took me by surprise
The problem is , did silent ever watch anime ? and cant wait to see FNG drafting core venge , silencer and some shit for silent lmao .
Man . I feel bad for Illidan . They are solid and the roster consistency is what made them top dogs . They also have a fun draft because of Illidan 's unorthodox hero pool . I m not impressed by silent everytime he plays with Empire . It 's usually Yoky , Reso for me carrying that team during TI5 and before that .
he was not prepared
VP . Silent looks so weird , it almost feels like he 's changing his name from Empire . Silent
so Empire . Xboct confirmed too ?
No wtf I do nt like this
I thought Illidan was one of the stronger players in VP personally .
WAT ? you dont simply replace the beast from the east . what madness is this .
Illidan Carry and Xboct Offlane for Empire . Both are great players with some chance of throwing games
Sub : Funn1k for more throw potential
Carry Venge is probably more the idea of Fng than Illidan himself , so it ( unfortunately ) stays .
Afaik fng picks heroes the other want or can play more or less .
Half the time , G plays Silencer too .
PR used to play it with Moonlight as their carry about 2 years ago , so it probably is fng 's master plan .
Yeah definitely FNG 's strat . I remember when FNG joined NaVi , they played carry venge too then .
Na Vi played the carry Venge before FNG . Seems like a common strat in CIS team i guess ?
Navi played core venge at TI3 , way before FNG era .
XBOCT is a guy that will either cost you every single game you play , or be the reason you reach the grand finals . And if you have to pick between a guy that guarantees you a top 10 finish , or a guy that gets you a 30 % chance at hitting the top 3 , I d go for option 2 any day of the week .
New patch kicks in , VS , Drow , Silencer buffed . Illidan will win the next major no matter whatever team he is on .
Even as a team Secret fan , Illidan has always been my favourite carry . Sad to see him go , he played so well in VP .
Hope he finds a new team that works well with his style of play !
I do nt think this will work .
the games VP wins are usually due to their versatility and unorthodox drafts like core Venge / Silencer / etc that teams simply are nt trained at playing against .
I guess they are nt particularly difficult heroes for Silent to pick up but I do nt see Silent being any better than Illidan on LAN given Empire 's LAN history and Silent 's inconsistency the past 6 months .
And reddit told me days ago that VP wo nt kick illidan for silent . 4Head
And here , the player with more than 1000 professional games for one team ( Empire ) is gone to another team .
v mixed feelings : i like silent and all but VP ai nt VP without their odd - ball carries . Hope Illidan finds a good team .
I still have Illidan 's TI3 Player card . The feels .
One yolo carry replaced with another one .
Why does the site have 18 + icon ? Russian doto offers porn ?

Good move by VP , Silent is by far the best carry in CIS
VP WAS NOT PREPARED
I prefer Illidan .
Pretty good change tbh .
Not a fan of Silent , but i think this is an upgrade for VP .
yeah illidan , what a carry he was . insane skills as a carry but also insane throwing skills as a player .

And with that Xboct goes to Empire which is great for them , while Illidan has no time to find good team . FeelsBadMan . I hope karma will get VP for that .
PLS Vote Xboct for Empire
did nt see that coming .
I knew this day would come : I just was nt expecting it to be this day .
Illidan was nt on the same level of his teammates in the last tournaments , but I think that he was the perfect fit in that team . I m sure that in less than 3 months VP will kick Silent .
This hurt a lot more than I thought it would .
Hope they ll both do better again in a new setting :
After watching over the dream , this makes me kinda sad
there can be only one beautiful girl in the team
Looks like xboct will eventually take his place in empire then .
You are replacing a wildly inconsistent and unpredictable carry with another wildly inconsistent and ( albeit less ) unpredictable carry . I do admit that Illidan was probably the weakest link on VP , but replacing him with Silent is nt much of an upgrade .
























































who cares
The people asking me to ?
Do it on , People here on , actually do nt care on the majority .




























I have some stats I want to get from pro games , so I need the game data , does anyone know the best way to get all the pro games ?
( I want to do things like graph the change in game length over time as patches come out )
just write to the datdota guys and ask if they can make certain data available for you .
That is an option , honestly I m surprised they have nt already done game length analysis . unless they have and I m just blind )
they are open for this stuff :
Did nt see that , thanks .
Download and parse the replays .
You what ?




























Yes , but in Low Prio !
Lmfao
Give it a go .




























It would take multiple days or even weeks to recreate this stuff since the basic code in the old client didnt got ported to reborn but rather deleted
























































Why did you go with the Puck example instead of the already existing OD one .
Because OD 's ability is for the most part an offensive ability rather than a defensive ability . Yes you can use it for a defensive ability but it 's better off being used as an offensive one .
what about shadow demon
And yet that one " saves " one person .
OD 's is absolutely not an offensive one because the enemy can just blink out of it . That 's one of the reasons OD is never played .
Some sort of fallout 4 reference ?
Indiana Jones reference also I think you ve been playing Fallout to much friend : P
I d be happy if the snowball 's duration was shorter and only tusk with 1 ally could enter it .
The game will never be completely fair . There will always be imbalances .
Icefrog has been working on the new dota balance patch for a months now , he doesnt balance everything based on what reddit says . He studies win percentages and other things , i can 100 % guarantee to you he realizes that the top tier heros right now need nerfs , he has been doing this for a very long time
Are nt you quite the bootlicker . I rather say something and have a chance of something getting done rather then say nothing and hope that Icefrog can mind read .
nothing op about a hero with 100 % p / b EleGiggle
























































Help a failing brother out .
I was around 3 . 3k mmr about a year ago before taking a break and only playing CS GO for months . Now that I ve returned to Dota I am only losing . I am now down to 2 . 4k mmr solo , 2 . 6k mmr team .
Do you have any ideas how to overcome this problem ?
Thanks
Practice . Play unranked . Take another break .
You pick Lycan . You tell your team that you will jungle . You tell your team that you will never fight with them . You tell your team that you will split push . You do this in a nice way because you are Lycan picker and you want to win . You buy stout , quelling , tangoes in that exact order . You go jungle . You get : level 7 , 4 - 0 - 2 - 1 skill build . You have : vlads , quelling , stout , smoke . You smoke and take rosh before 10 minutes . You time that motherfucker . You buy brown boots . You go push a lane or take ancients if there is no safe lane to push . You repeat until game is won . You never fight with your team ever . You never fight without your team ever . Wolves need no armour . Why do wolves need no armour you may ask ? Wolves need no armour because wolves never fight ; wolves split push . This is why wolves need no armour . Your team dying 4 mid ? You do not fight with them . You do not teleport to them . You do not flame them . You are Lycan and you want to win . You have teleportation scrolls but you use them to get to lanes as far away from danger as possible and push . You tell your team to fight under tower . You tell your team not to come to your lane . You do this in a nice way because even though wolves need no armour wolves want to win games . If you are getting ganked ( you should be looking at the mini map and not be in a situation where youre getting ganked ) but if you are getting ganked you know what to do : you listen to Lycan and Lycan tells you what ? Thats right you sonofabitch : Lycan tells you that " the wolf runs " You pop that ultimate , you back off and you TP out . You push another lane or you farm jungle / farm ancients / smoke roshan . If you do nt know what to do then what do you do ? That 's right ; you listen to Lycan again and Lycan tells you that " the wolf runs " and that " wolves need no armour " This does not mean " the wolf fights " it means that the wolf go split push . You are on a lane preferably furthest away from danger . You are in the jungle or at the ancients farming . You are at roshan getting that aegis timing that shit . You get necro 1 , 2 , 3 . You upgrade your brown boots into boots of travel . You do it in this exact order . You keep that split push going . You smoke rosh whenever he 's up . You keep telling your team not to be with you or come to your lanes . You are Lycan . You are nice about it . You are split push . You are objectives . You are win . You remember that " wolves love to battle " against structures because then wolves will need no armour and wolves can run in circles around the structures . You never fight . You end the game with 0 - 0 - 0 and the highest building damage ever conceived by man .

This is golden
You should write a book .
I ll agree on the point that you ll be a better player learning this overall .
Do you think you have the same skill level ?
i do think valve should implement some sort of ( optional ? MMR decay ( half - life ) A lot of us are nt obsessed with our MMR score , and if you take a break from dota and you decide to go back , you know that you ll be expected to immediately play at the same level ( even unranked still has its own MM )
I ve taken a 3 - 4 month break from Dota and am just starting to get back into it . I ve been practising in bots , just to get my farming patterns , map awareness and reaction times back up . I use bot games often for practising farming patterns , so I just try to match my old stats .
If you ve just had a years break , why in the world are you playing Ranked .
Play around in unranked , get a feel for all the changes that have been made and find which heroes you enjoy playing and are good at . Dont worry about the meta in 2 - 3k mmr , you can pick any hero and win as long as you play well enough .
Good luck ! Just remember , its only a game , have fun . Its not all about MMR
sometimes things just happen in streaks , I am in a rough patch right now as well , last week I had 7 games in a row that I won with the best random team mates I ve ever had our lanes were great , communication was great and all the games were a blast ! then I lost 11 out of 13 , leavers , feeders , peruvians , etc .
A whole bunch of heroes got new and useful aghs upgrades like tusk and riki . Make sure to take advantage of this situation .
It seems you were thrown in Elo Foulfell , also known as the Elo Hell of Elo Hell . Here are a few simple steps to getting out of Elo Foulfell :
1 ) Pick Terrorblade .
To elaborate on these steps ,
1 ) is simple . Simply pick Terrorblade as a third pick . Terrorblade is , by far , the best and only hero that can break out of Elo Foulfell .
2 . 1 ) Most players reject their inner feeder , causing those feelings to be projected onto their shadow selves / teammates . In order to overcome them , you must accept the teammates / shadow selves , and abuse their tendency to feed in order to secure objectives . Whenever your teammates are feeding , take the opportunity to deal some damage to the enemy tower .
3 . 2 ) Once you managed to make at least two enemy heroes / Foulfell guards teleport to the tower / prison wall of Foulfell you are destroying , immediately run to a safe location and teleport into the teamfight . This will cause the enemy team to be completely destroyed .
move the mouse faster and press faster on the keys
Enter someone 's inventory as riki and hope they carry the game for you .




























Guess he is going through the open qualifiers
No roster locks cause the same issues but much worse .
Yeah , I guess you a right




























In the DotA build creator , it is impossible to add recipes ! This is extremely annoying for my Techies item build as I am unable to one click purchase Soul Ring Recipe . This has been bugging me for so long , hopefully it 's in 6 . 8 . 6
Lol what ? Just put soul ring in your quick buy dumb ass
Techies and Dark Seer sometimes like to buy the recipe before they come to lane , and get the other two components from the side shop .

For the big deal tournaments , there should really be a stream with subtitles . Being a deaf Dota fan probably sucks .

Yes . Everything is live audio so deaf people would be left out . Or in my case person watching at work where I ca nt have audio playing .
At TI they had subtitles of all pre - recorded videos but not live stuff as far as I could tell .
edit : misread your comment first time .
























































k
You never go full shitpost .




























TA is nt picked a lot in the competitive scene . Here is a suggestion which I think would make her more viable
Nobody wants to see TA picked in competitive . She 's absolutely annoying and who wants to see supports get one shot ?
She 's picked plenty in pro . A hero does nt need a buff just because its not picked every game .
Did nt EG pick her at Frankfurt Major ? She 's just a massive pain to deal with , she has to be kept at a neutral power - level because at the least with moderate farm , she ll one shot one of your teammates as initiation .
You want to buff TA ? Are you mental ?
























































Would nt the patch basically be ready to go by now besides bug fixes that still need to made ? So does anything that gets suggested now , that 's actually a good suggestion stand a chance of getting added to 6 . 86 or will it only maybe get added in a later patch ?




























Did nt burning 's Rapier get destroyed back in dota 1 and the he just farmed another one in like 4 - 5 minutes ?

3 / 5 of the old MYM DOTA team . Not bad at all .
Sadly too late : These guys were so good back then .
People seem to not understand that this is a joke . This is just a response to Synderen 's tweet .
Veggie gaming fanboy here
Yeah pretty sure it 's not a serious team .
wait , what ? Did his LoL team disband ?
Pretty sure they did / are going to .

,
the blitz twitter link is left out . WHAT COULD THIS MEAN ?
Blitz is left Kappa
Would nt that make them really good since lower tier numbers ( e . g . tier 1 and tier 2 ) imply better teams ?
yea but negative numbers do nt exist
They re so good that they re negative tier !
i guess negative karma does :

This joke made me really happy thanks Maelk
I would love to watch them play .
Kappa
lol this is a joke right ? best of luck if not .
are we getting trolled ? steak and now veggie and i though synderen was returning for real .
Do they cast their own games ?
If what I heard is true and Cap is like almost 7k , it 's not even that bad , Maelk would actually be the worst player of the team
Maelk will be maelk going 0 - 20 - 30 and win the game kappa
Even this is a joke from Maelk , I would love to see this stack plays with a Tier 3 - 4 team . It would be hilarious .
HI REEK
The funniest thing about this is that Blitz is already registered as a stand - in on Team Steak , which Maelk is satirizing .
C A S T E R T E A M
Maelk Venomancer HYPE !
Savage .
If this is true , I think we re running out of casters and co - caster . I apply to anyone that needs one kappa
Are these teams serious ? Or are they just for fun ?
I think the Synderen team is serious , but this is just Maelk fucking around .
Blitz is already a sub for team steak
better than na vi
This will surely last
this team is going nowhere .
we re going to lose a lot of good caster it seems :

Next you are going to tell me that Morphling , Puck & CK are also OP as fuck .
> Arc Warden
Pick one .
Also it seems flux is doing damage in 1 second intervals while it should do it in much smaller intervals ( 0 . 1 or 0 . 2 do nt remember )
Fuck , I just realized : Arc Warden in ability draft will fucking crash the servers with bugs . Calling it now .
Do nt think so . Meepo worked well . It was just op .
The more of these posts that I see , I get the feeling that Arc Warden is overpowered as fuck .
This , is an incredibly accurate description of Arc Warden . I d also like to point out he has essentially the slowest projectile speed in Dota , and sits in the slowest turn rate category . He does farm very quickly with Midas though . Try to gank him in lane , he lacks any real escape mechanism , you do not want Zet getting Midas .
as it should be . its going to be lots of fun .

DotA1 inconsistancies :
That 's all I got .
I know , I know - Yet another time I am doing this thread .
Trust me , this will ( most likely ) be the last one of these , prior to 6 . 86 in ~ 2 weeks . I just want the new hero to be as bug - free as possible - thats it .
If Arc Warden has an Aghanim 's Scepter buff ( granted by Alchemist ) then he & his Tempest Double will spawn with different HP values upon casting the Tempest Double spell .
Before using Ultimate : Arc Warden HP , Tempest Double HP , not spawned yet )
After casting Ultimate : Arc Warden HP , loses 30 % of HP ) Tempest Double HP , due to the missing Aghanim 's Scepter buff )
The Aghanim 's Scepter buff grants Arc Warden additional 390 HP ( 200 HP + 10 Strength ) The Tempest Double does not benefit from permanent Buffs ( yet ? so it lacks these 390 HP .
The Tempest Double copies the , and then calculates his own , of the main hero ( Tempest Double ignores permanent buffs )
Thus the , despite the , to summon his Tempest Double .

In DotA1 the Spark Wraiths have a small 100 AoE Vision , if you place them inside of fog . You always had vision of the Sparks themselves , but also a small 100 AoE vision of the ground below them .
In Dota 2 Spark Wraiths give zero vision . You can still see them in the fog ( similar to the Spirit 's remnants ) This has always been bugged in Dota 2 . Intended nerf or is it just not properly ported ?
Regardless which permanent buff we are talking about , the Tempest Double does not replicate it .
The Tempest Double should be a perfect copy of the Arc Warden ( according to flavor text & skill description ) and yet it does not copy permanent buffs from the main hero .
We now know that the Tempest Double does not grant Arc Warden 's Aghanims Scepter buff , but can Alchemist give the buff to the tempest directly ? Yes , he can .
Rubick will steal the last spell that was used by EITHER the Arc Warden OR the Tempest Double , regardless of which of these units he uses spell steal on .
Rubick will steal the spell which was used last by EITHER Arc Warden OR Tempest Double , regardless which of these he uses spell steal on . Can be a buff , can be a nerf . It is most certainly a bug , though .
A bottle that contains a rune will not be given to the Tempest Double .
The Tempest Double gets an empty bottle instead ( even though the main hero has a full bottle that contains a rune ) Intended or bugged ? Should the Tempest Double get a full bottle , because the main hero actually has a full bottle ( that contains a rune )
The Tempest Double should ( of course ) NOT get a Bottle that contains a Rune ( ez double Double Damage Rune ) but simply a full - 3 charges - Bottle , instead of an empty one .
The main hero carries a full bottle ( which contains an additional rune ) so the Double should get a full bottle ( without a rune , though )
Tempest Double is able to clone a walking & flying courier . If done properly this can grant you a new walking / flying courier for free . Intended or bugged ?
at least you are nt doing an Arc Warden Aghs suggestion
Arc warden aghs suggestion :
6 . 86 does nt sound like a good place to me . o . O
Maybe if the hp cost is like 60 % instead of 30 %
So you double the HP cost , but you also get double the Tempest Doubles ? Seems fine .
Still better than Refresher Orb , due to stats .
I am keeping that one for his release . Trust me , i thought of one dank Zet Aghs .
Honestly ca nt wait for your reaction when Pit Lord is released and Arc Warden is pushed back another patch .
Maybe has something to do with bounty runes ?
The tempest double doesnt benefit from any runes at all .
He should get a 3 - charges - bottle , without a Rune , regardless if the main hero has a 3 - charges - bottle with or without a Rune .
I was very concerned , but you snuck the Spark Wraith targeting bug in at the end . Of all the inconsistencies , this is the one I want changed the most . The entire way Spark Wraith will have to be used to single out targets will be determined by this one function . I would prefer it be as in DotA 1 , rather than having to use it like SD .
They have a shop buy cooldown , just like wards .
Have they really said that Arc Warden will be added next patch ?
iirc valve said they were adding new heros in a big patch after the major aka 6 . 86
they were talking about - adding content - not specifically heroes .
there is no written law that there have to be new heroes every x months . we demand it and they served us well so far , but it is their decision if and when they release new stuff .
It 's not like the game is unplayable this way , we have over a hundred heroes and got some new items which changed the game drastically . And with the balancing patches they keep the game fresh as well . I would like to see new heroes , but I m not mad at them if they take another . 4 months to publish them .
This kills the Warden .
hey you just published a 500 pages post about bugs of the warden . I guess you would like to see them fixed , eh ?
Valve can do it in 2 weeks .
Otherwise you re seriously awesome for doing this ! I m sure people will appreciate that you re helping make the launch of Arc Warden smoother .
You can choose to specifically email the Dota 2 team on their website .

I m sure they would like to hear about this post on the off chance that they missed it . If the OD immortal is nt fixed I suppose you can send an email too . Just limit it to serious emails plz k thx .
Do nt worry Valve still have a lot of time to fix your precious Arc Warden because Pit Lord will be release first . Kappa !
Keep in mind I have you tagged . 13 days remaining .
I tagged him as the warden lord
The dominator thing reminds me of how Morph can copy LD and summon another bear . Thing is , when he turns back into Morphling , the bear only dies after a few seconds .
I feel like the vision nerf is just a nerf . they seem to have this coded onto other abilities easy enough so I do nt know why else they would nt have this in .
Literally unplayable .
I think all the scepter related bugs are balance features . However , the duel and silencer ones may be bugs .
How can i test the hero ?
Check the video 's description .
You can either manually play him vs bots ( via the tools mode ) or just Arc Warden himself in my Custom Game .
thanks , i found your custom game now .
Puck Keepo
We re close
Embrace EE ~ sama !
he is not even release and you complain about bugs ?
His spells are in the game , so of course .
Wait , silly me , of course you do nt .
should we wait until he is forced upon us with bugs for us to find , reborn style ?
We re still in beta , bruh .
and always will be , frog willing .

Just make it so that the decline button has to be clicked 2 times in order to decline .
Obviously , Valve wants to punish players for watching games during queues instead of staring at the queue timer . By doing this , they encourage everyone to be mentally prepared for the DotA game ahead .




























Ask your school if they are blocking it .




























Quality game , Quality Dota ! Quality throws from Mineski though but still 1 - 1 GGWP
That useless agh scepter on Wraith King though .
What a fun game !
It would nt be a Mineski game if they DID know how to close out the game .
Fnatic did a good job holding on to their base too !
DJ looking good on whatever position . Or it is just the quality of enemies ? Still , decent performance on games 1 and 2 as support . This might be the arrangement Fnatic is looking for .




























How does it feel to have a 100 % win rate in 2015 ?

Memes aside , I d rly love AMA from him
Literally just pop onto his twitch stream and ask him questions while highlighting him .
He almost always talks to his chat .
Alternatively , make a three dollar donation . Then you re guaranteed an answer . The more you swear , the more he likes you
well , he is pretty dank so . that goes with it 4Head

Well now with a new team , would be really nice to see an AMA
Do you see yourself in TI6 as a player ?
imagine him playing and commenting ti6 final at the same time Kappa
Yes
Which player put this team together ? Is it Synderen 's team or was he invited ?
He stood in for Alliance , but Synderen did announce being with a new team who have nt played yet
We
Yes
No thx

Glad the bot creator finally included a link so we could see the code .
Can someone explain how it grabbed that from just an image ?
Check the GitHub link
Oh LOL , I did nt even click it since I do nt know shit about programming .
its explain everything
Doot doot , thx bot
You ve become my favorite shit - poster .
best team ever , will never forget !
With these losses , I have officially moved OG and Team Secret from Tier 1 team to Tier 4 .
That 's not enough ! They re LITERALLY the worst teams ever ! 1
They did nt disband ?
finally someone who knows what it is
ftfy
You will get a shock when you grow up then .
Everyone is waiting for the new patch .
They do nt seem interested at all I suppose
yeah starladder right now is just a bunch of teams looking to make a quick buck off of their shitty slardar / wr / tusk strats

But when he dies , you get a secret . Worth .
Well played .
leaking .
I love puppey , he can make some brilliant drafts , but you ca nt just take recent history into account . He goes full yolo sometimes .
Thats why he had never won a TI as a captain ,
EE has been practicing Sven on his smurf if you watched his streams .
The problem was there was a lot of uncoordinated and mistakes that Secret made since they have nt played together in a while since the last Majors .
Also online vs LAN .
Thank God someone said it . The only reason I came to this thread
[ deleted ]
It would take a ton of lost games for Secret not to be invited to lans .
Which you could argue the case for both ursa and Sven .
was nt illidan playing ?
No . It was Envy who had Illidan as a part of his name before games began . Apparently Illidan is his new favourite person in Dota .
Good against : Gyro , SF Alch , Huskar
? Tiny , Lina
Bad against : Tusk , Wyvern , QoP , DS , AM , PL , Naga , WR , Brood , Dazzle
Ursa is a pocket strat hero .
He 's a worse alternative for Broodmother in the sense that you can bait drafts that cant deal with him . But in a great majority of drafts he ll be kited to death .
Just because some games it feels like it 's over in the draft .
I know it does nt always turn out like that anyway but when it does it 's not fun to watch .
Ursa Mag is legit dude what are you talking about .
Vega is good .
Probably ca nt count out EE ping disadvantage and I wonder if they re actually a little sick of dota and wanting 6 . 86 I mean they ve played a fuck ton for the past month or 2
They met half way , right at the borderline
Vega played well .
It felt like Team Secret were all so out of it .
Pretty sure they re just fooling around . When has Envy ever played Ursa and Sven ?
There is a possibility that they re trying things around , since tournament settings are better than scrim settings when it comes to truly seeing whether or not a strategy works for you . I doubt that they re just fooling around though .
Considering they do nt really scrim much , tournament settings are pretty much where they practice .
That 's what I meant . They want to try new things because they re bored of the meta .
That kind of is fooling around .
Not really , you wo nt know if things really work out as assumed unless the test environment is set out for it .
Today tho I think Vega just outplayed secret and it was nt even that much about the picks as it was about the overall flow of the games . Vega played faster dota .
I doubt Secret is playing their best in irrelevant tournaments with such weird picks . I think they re just seeing if / how these picks work and possibly how well they work against teams such as Vega .
He 's been playing Sven on stream .
Does nt mean they have to be tryharding .
It 's , of course he 's tryharding . On the other hand I ve never seen him win with Sven on stream .
you just do nt play like that into ursa + aa + bane lane
Came here to say that Alliance stomped Vega last time they encountered , so it means that :
Alliance > Vega > Secret .
Also , let 's not forget Alliance > NaVi > OG .
Alliance literally the best team in the entire world KappaPride
Mineski > Alliance
Mineski > Alliance > Navi > OG > Vega > Secret . Mineski confirmed TI6 champs .
no Kappa
Alliance are Back
Secret are Front
But Alliance got 2 - 0 ed by OG BibleThump
saving strats
They also did nt have SyndereN . Lets be real here 4Head
Secret . Artstyle
bugattis have been won
Scientists have been baffled .
Secret have nt played together since majors and it showed
Majors were less than 2 weeks ago .
That 's a pretty long time .
No , it 's not , it 's just 10 days .
I d say that 's still a pretty long time to not play with your team .
And you know they have nt played together how ?
Hmm . his match checks out .
How 's dumb shit like this upvoted lol
i ve lost almost all my trade - able items this week fml
That 's the Envy i know and love !
The C9 players are SO SHIT
chi long qua kappa
Maybe it 's just one of those games son , one of those games .
Nah its just the time of the year where the russians are getting super strong . Just like previous years , vp polar , empire , etc always looks scary during winter .
the snow gives them power !
Hitler approves
this the time where they kick notail and fly and bring in rtc and zai
oh wait
Statistically , Sven with bkb daedalus blink mask of madness is the best build .
More like secret and OG broke each other
First game . Literally no action on the map for the first 15 minutes . This is everything but " fight early and often "
The second game , though .
You re right about the first game . I do nt know why Secret did nt try to put more pressure earlier though . Lina and Bane is enough to kill anyone at 5 minutes in . They just played a really passive first 10 minutes for no real reason . Secret loses teamfights almost guaranteed versus Vega 's heroes .
I guess my point is that they were playing for the midgame when they needed to try to win the early game to win .
edit *
Winter is right around the corner
Vega teaching Secret how to play Ursa .
Puppey saving strats for TI6 .
No professional team is gonna take this game seriously until the next patch arrives .
Its like Vega is the new Empire .
Im sure we lost TI6
any VODS of the games ?
edit : pretty sure i m gonna get downvoted to oblivion by some retards that think secret is a shit team now
Only this is a qualifier for a LAN with a $ 300k prize pool .
1 8 0 0 0 0 A R E N A
Implying secret will ever recieve the starladder money
This is a LAN qualifier
That is played online . Secret have always hated starladder .
if you hate a tournament you just dont play it
It does seem likely they were nt trying that hard .
Either secret did nt care , or they were experimenting something crazy . I just ca nt think of another explanation for drafting , and playing that badly .
How about Vega outplayed / outdrafted em
Dark days , truly
Typical , finding sad excuses for a team instead of admitting that their opponent outplayed / outdrafted / out - whatever them .
maybe they had a bad day u retard cmon
cuz it failed and u came out of her ass
) idiot
I ll just pretend that game did nt happen . it 's funny that tier 5 teams can stomp vega , yet secret , still cant beat them , pretty hilarious .
just a quick reminder , that Vega had nothing to play in the games vs MVP today . They were already qualified for DreamHack Moscow .
because secret is tier 7
actually shit tier
Very depressing . I m hoping secret can pull it together for the next series . Not even outdrafted . Just insanely outplayed .
The fanboy in me wants to they that they are experimenting with different picks for the major , but even then , they are still bring outplayed all over the map .
Only one series tho , so you never know
Dear EE . This was an official tournament . Why didnt you show up and let your team loose with this underperforming stand in ? A Fan
Misery , EE and ArtStyle , I mean Puppey played bad . Secret just did nt quite get into their groove . They ll surely bounce back though .
Did Illidan stand in for Envy ?
Everyone seems to be down voting you for asking a simple question and still no one provided the answer ! Typical ,
why everybody seems so surprised ? vega showed already that they are the better team , they were just rly unlucky at the major and / or had a bad day
what happened to Secret ? Looks like something is wrong with the team .
But they ve won 2 lans already , beating the best western and eastern teams in both , and came second in major . None of what you say makes sense , all of that was nt one giant fluke or example of their " inconsistency " Secret have been maybe the most consistently good team since TI . How can a team be underwhelming when they re getting to every final out there !
we are talking bout now . not the past . right now their play just looks like out of place since the major .
They have literally played one series since major . You talk like the major was a year ago , was literally less than 2 weeks ago .




























The game was decided 6 minutes in . How is this fair ? I mean the guy never got passed level 1 , is nt there any way to detect that ?
did this guy by any chance random sniper ?

Where can I find the team page in the reborn client ? I really want to make a team with my friends but I ca nt find it .





























Jerax is awful on defensive supports , constantly out of position .

Seems like Liquid really lost the plot ever since they lost Frankfurt qualifiers .

( he may still cant believe , that u rly did get one haha )
Good work ! nice pics
Did you ask why did Mynuts change his name to Nuts ?
If it 's his actual name , then you ca nt really punish a guy for using it .
Still make me laugh when I saw loda with . a cap again .
That 's a good camera .
And good lighting . You can see his dead skin flakes in the tattoo picture .

After going through all this bullshit drama , I realized I was very wrong about you Nahaz . I flamed you but now I know that you bring something unique to the table . Thanks for that , and apologies .
Good guy Nahaz not strangling people .
We also need to note that Synderen was still finishing off his Masters degree in English whilst doing most of that so hopefully with more time on his hands now can continue .
I love you nahaz !
Hey man , do you know who is doing the picks / bans / taking the captain 's chair ?
This game or Synd 's last game ?
This game Loda drafted for Alliance
ty , was just wondering . since S4 has been doing that recently .
mouz cr1t , another mouz player that made it big after leaving BibleThump
thanks man nice info . You are awesome .

pro players . and synderen Keepo
Synderen is back
It 's now 26 minutes in and ODPixel is nt making fun of Synderen anymore .
Synderell [ A ] confirmed
He is actually 5 - 5 - 26 atm , not bad at all !
It 's a meme for years now . But actually he was a pretty decent support and had some nice drafts . The old mousesports were really entertaining to watch . And syndereN had the best W / L ratio on Nyx back in the support Nyx times . Good times . Miss my mousesports .
Enjoy
And he just announced that he actually is back with a new team , holy shit . I m pretty sure I should nt be hyped cause he was nt that amazing when he was playing .
neither was cr1t . now look at cr1t . hopefully Synderen 's gonna be good .
If they work hard , they ll do it .
Pro players . Not in both teams 4Head KappaPride
You re right , s4 is nt the first name when you think about a potential shuffle for Alliance .
Akke , Loda or Nuts kick incoming unless they are secretly 8k mmr
Nuts has been a breath of fresh air for this team . I really do nt see it being him .
Nope hes solid which doesnt help the team as Akke + Loda is locked , Bulldong is Alliance and S4 is performing just not drafting right
You ca nt blame s4 solely for the drafts , he is very limited with the players he has to work with and the whole team probably has a lot of input when deciding .
The fact that Loda and Akke is locked is quite sad tbh , I truly believe it is them that are the two weakest links .
Okay , you can say a lot of things about Alliance but limited hero pool is not one of them .
His bans are more time then not quite questionable but yeah I agree this patch doesnt not favor alliance
A nuts kick would be good for the entire team

Ca nt kick Loda , is nt his girlfriend the manager or something ?
Not anymore I think
I think everyone needs to realise what this " manager " position really is . Her job is taking care of the players , making sure they can focus on the game . She has no team powers to keep or kick players .
Honestly , i think bulldong and s4 are still tier 1 players . I just wanna see them in a different team . Loda + akke just doesnt work anymore

Did he ever actually retire the first time , or has he just been waiting 2 years for a team to ask him to join ? 4Head
Synd is actually doing some work here .
New team : Synderen + Friends Kappa
Synderen + experts ?
4E & S
Why is Synd standing in ?
Apparently S4 fell asleep .
Lose the Major , lose the girls .
Yes .
Apparently , according to ODpixel S4 is sleeping
" Professional " gaming 4Head
To be fair , if a professional basketball player was asleep , he also would nt be playing .

To his defense , he probably stayed up all night thinking about that zeus draft . SoBayed
almost but not yet : D
Nope , navi 322 .
now if alliance lose the next two matches , how much reddit will blame s4 ?
He is back :

,

So many things that are back in this match
Synd , being the true memer he is , has realised that if you leave dazzle for art style it 's an EZ win EleGiggle
He 's making some big plays too .
Mynuts was massive
And they won . SYNDERWIN PogChamp
Well , his " offlane only " streams seem to be paying off .

Synderen just got kicked out of Alliance
Now that synderen is back , who 's next ? Merlini ? Kappa
Merlini

Synderen

WTF 1 SYNDEREN PogChamp
Synderen did pretty good , are we gonna loose our favorite caster ? Only Game 2 will tell .
For a person who did nt play competitive DotA for almost two years , Synderen 's Undying was great . I ve read posts stating that he 's practicing for an offlane position . He 's doing good so far .
Feederen ? WutFace
Why does this not have the comedy tag ?
They are actually doing decent right now .
S - god Kreygasm
Vod ?
Synderen > S OpieOP SeemsGood
no team is stupid enough to kick s4
V1lat said that Synd and Era will form a team together . Seeing Synd as a stand - in here , I think that V1lat might be telling the truth .
MY BUGATTI NotLikeThis
Alliance is . BACK
synderen is back to business
It 's nice to see Loda play something other than Gyro . I feel the problem is often that they ca nt transition Gyro effectively into the late game . They always win early and lose late with that hero .
Synderen is back to win TI Kappa
omg wish I had seen that !
S4 still sleeping .
Well , if i were asleep just before a match . I would just let Synderen finish the series
I wish he would go back to sleep tbh
Maybe the rumours from V1lat were nt bullshit after all
go on .
I do nt have a primary source . Someone said they watched V1lat stream and V1lat said new team Era + Synd + 3
No idea if he 's correct but Era tweeted this right now


,

What rumours ?
I believe it was about Era + Synd forming a team , potential with Sing2x as well .
yes pls
Navi was beaten by the pro players on Alliance . and synderen .
I cant imagine synd playing mid , i am going to guess wisp + loda hero on mid bulldog safelane synd offlane dank seer .
s4 is playing again ? alliance lost .
my rares .
LMAO WHAT NOW NA SHIT FANGAY
I hope s4 is nt quitting from Alliance right now , I would punch him for that .
edit : not gonna happen EleGiggle
that would be stupid with new patch around the corner
Does synd actually know / understand swedish ?
Danish / Swedish is fairly interchangeable .
Pretty much . Very hard to make out the words in danish .
But do they have V A L F A R D in Denmark ?

Oh boy , its the end of Alliance now .
And synderen dies at the 4 minutes mark .
Dirtya Ra Sven ? I m watching . As soon as I join , 9 ( navi ) 22 ( a ] Then Dirtya Ra engage and you see nothing is yet done .

This Bane pick has just ruined Na Vi in game 1 , he has got a full duration ult off on either Sven or SF in every single fight .
Honestly with the money flowing through the scene people like synd would be thinking about going pro again
He is , actually
Should ve let Synderell [ A ] play the whole series .
New drama , Synderen was right , S4 was left .
So does S4 just not get the meta or can his teammates just not play the meta heroes ? A ) drafts are so out there .
Synderen is supporting , Nuts is playing now New drama , Synderen was right , S4 was left .
Alliance > NaVi
Does anyone have the VOD for game 1 ?
Any VODs ?




























Otherwise this system just does nt work . I got a dc and needed to win only 1 game in Low Priority , but took me 4 games to complete , because people who had 5 games would just abandon unpunished if they were losing .
edit : or at least give it a time ban for people who abandon at 5 games if giving them more games is nt optimal , it just ca nt remain unpunished .
Also I think that if you start with say 5 games the first abandon or two should increase games required to 6 or 7 but not more . After that , the lock - out happens . If you have an infinitely increasing low prio games count then there 's no point for those dudes to try . Just like with the guys that got 40 years low priority , there 's just no point in NOT abandoning at that point . That 's why it becomes better to just lock them out . They can go play custom games until they want to try again .
This is the best solution .
was there an actual guy with 40 years ?
So much glorious justice .
0
^ This is a different guy since I could nt find the original glorious thread , this guy got 42 years lpq presumably from being potentially the most reported guy in dota2 , or perhaps just from the game bugging out . The guy that flamed the valve dev got something insane like 40 years lpq too iirc .
haha pretty sweet !
Holy shit , even with such an obvious bug people are still trying to justify his LP time .
I knew people with weeks of LPQ back in the day , that number would nt surprise me
how about life long low priority punishment in extreme cases ?
I do nt think you need to make it life long . It just has to keep getting slightly longer . Please remember that if you make it absolutely permanent then the player has no reason to not abandon every game , which ( again ) defeats the purpose of it all .
i . e . 2 hours - 6 hours - 12 hours - 24 hours - 48 hours - 96 hours etc etc . Perhaps it could cap out at 4 days ( 96 hours )
I want a hidden low - prio , which is where the people in normal low - prio go for bad behaviour in normal low - prio .
You do your time in normal low - prio , and if you got lots of reports , lots of abandons etc during your time in low - prio , you get into the hidden low - prio , but it just looks like you got out of low - prio .
Fuck people who behave badly , fuck them harder if they do it again once they re in low - prio .
I d add two to be honest . I get people sometimes DC beyond their control , but if it happens multiple times , you re kind of at fault there . Even if you did nt do it to be an asshole , you still ruined the game for your team if they have to 4v5
Yeah but who would nt want to be punched in the dick by our lord and savior ?
I would nt .
I d prefer a system where even outside of LPQ you re still matched with people who are just like you and often headed back to LPQ on a higher priority than regular pubbies who rarely talk or troll games .
from dev forum :
I believe this is already being done .

well its a low priority game , everyone in the game has left games and ruined for their team mates . and now this happens to them to
i cant see the problem
You only have to abandon once now , actually ( but the punishment is only winning one game )
Does abandoning like at the start of laning phase count ? I believe I did nt get LPQ for that xd
I think Ranked should auto give at least 1 game if you abandon in those matches .
In a ranked match ?
No , unranked . I did nt know ranked was default what people discuss .
In ranked if you abandon it 's instant LPQ .
Nope , you re wrong . Ranked or unranked have the same punishment system . The reason why , does nt get LPQ is because it 's his first abandon in forever . You need to abandon a few times in a certain span of time to get an abandon .
Just add one , you can either stay and have the same number of games or you can leave and have one more . It 's supposed to be low priority but the punishments should be linear .
If they do nt want to give more games as punishment , then make it time based . But abandoning at 5 games should nt remain unpunished .
We had time based low prio , I was in low prio for 300 days back in my 3k days lol .
What did you do to get 300 days of it ?
Naga jungle mostly .
It used to just build up off itself and how closely you were to your last punishment .
I abandoned every game I thought was lost ( This was 2 years back and I was quite the immature noob ) and low prio time used to stack . Then valve reset low prio and I still managed to get like 2 weeks of low prio and then they removed that system completely .
WoW my friend still has like 1000 games for some reason . he wo nt play Dota anymore : D . But didnt know that was reset . I ll probably tell him if he didnt lose his account .
there 's a cap on 5 maximum low prio games atm , was 16 before now 5 . 1000 games was never possible what the hell lol
Why are you getting downvoted ?
Because reddit .
is based on , you know
Maybe they should make it more like how csgo 's system works :

Is nt this how the old system worked ?
this is a good idea , then they would not be getting anywhere , and people with actual DC issues wont be punished .
reported enjoy lp
i too was posting things like " they should suffer " but just think about new players , my friend recently started dota2 i taught him to play drow and wk , he was like 30 hours of game play hours , he drops into lp due to internet connection , he somehow managed to get 3 lps , boom first match kotl , earth spirit , brood he stayed in lp for 1 week trying to win with heroes he never played and just quit dota afterwards ! single draft eats the shit out of new players !
You do nt get LP just by 1 or 2 DCs . If he was disconnecting on a regular basis , then his Internet is shit and he should nt be playing online games anyway .
wrong , you get LP from 2 DCs
yeah judge him based in his internet connection , why did he not reach the limit of 5 lps if he has shit internet ?
Brood is an easy win . Pop open chrome , read a short guide and dominate your lane . This is not true if you lane against axe , timber or legion , then you are fucked I they have 1 / 2 a brain .
Meanwhile , the players that are actually trying to get out of LP games by playing them are getting screwed in almost all their matches .
why did you get in low prio in the first place ?
My friend got stuck there for a while because of computer / internet problems , it 's not only ragers and assholes
Think he was being sarcastic .
The real difference to regular dota is that it 's easier to find friends because everyone wants to get some mate that he can play LPQ together with .
Haha never thought about it like that , interesting point you have there .
Tbh , one abandon does nt put you there . If you disconnect from 3 games in a row because " computer / internet problems " you re still sort of an asshole for playing that many games with " computer / internet problems "
once was a loss of connection and the other was reborn being reborn
he did nt knew it was wrong
he got reported after posting " in all chat .
Is that something people report ?
People report anything
They make me angry . I agree with reporting solely for that reason .
he played naga siren .
he played techies .
Sorry officer , I . did nt know I could nt do that .
You re missing the point . People are abusing the fact that 5 games is the cap , so they leave games they re losing in order to save time - while not getting additional punishment .
So in essence , people trying to play real games are being punished more , while leavers are saving time by abandoning games they might lose , since they re already at the 5 cap .
Sure , but those other leavers and trolls have their own punishment , and they got that punishment for a reason .
The justice is they re feeling what other players felt when they had to deal with them leaving the game .
They stay in LPQ .
How is this a difficult concept .
But the people that do nt abandon do nt stay in LPQ , it 's not like they re going to get an abandoner in every single game , they ll get out eventually .
It 's a punishment for a reason .
In a game , if you get the same treatment for abandoning and not abandoning , people who do nt like where the game is headed will abandon . So , LPQ reinforces the " abandon if unhappy " behavior . That 's bad design .
The people who keep abandoning will stay in LPQ , the ones who do nt will get out . I do nt see how that 's bad design .
People who abandon games they seem to be losing , instead of playing it to the end with a loss , will get out of LPQ faster , because they save time by abandoning .
The original topic is to punish people who abandon games , the current punishment is simply to allow them to leave and find a match going in their favor when in reality it should be adding more games that they have to win not simply keeping them where they re at .
Just because they are abandoning among other people who probably did the same is not a good enough excuse for not applying more punishment to them . Similar to how you go to jail for murder and then murder someone in jail you re punished again and not simply with " you ll never get out now !
yeah no read that again
It 's not . But the , 9k mmr shit - stains think it is , and if you speak out against it you re downvoted .
Well I spoke out just then and looks like I m doing pretty darn good so far
I won a game the other day where a guy on my team had a broken right mouse button .
I had to teach him that you can a - click to attack things , and m - click to move .
anyway , I do nt know what my point was .
That 's not his point though . Read the post first then comment .
What if you crash or if your internet goes down ? I just got out of LP last night and now I m back in due to losing connection .
Yeah keep punishing them . For those of us who might end up there once in a blue moon , it should be an easier road out .
Create a second shadow low pri level for those people called : maximum security low - priority "
* Queues take an extra 10 minutes to start a game even if it found all 10 players .
* All cosmetics won in those games will immediately dissapear from the player 's inventory , but only after they see that they have won them ( clicked the " accept " box )
* Game will have a base 250 ping , to which regional ping is then added .
Nobody who is nt a complete dumbass could think these things
Of course this is ironic .
that 's some damn fine satire .
you forgot it 's ,
You re insane . Going to that much trouble does nt make any sense at all .
The funny part is that two of these are already in place for LoL 's low priority queue ( 10 minute base wait time , ca nt play again until the game ends )
Then hopefully that queue will be permanent , I would nt want to play with the people that come out of these matches .
Maybe we could just send them all to the worst server there is : the SEA server .
You cant even get out of LP because of this .
I have been saying it forever but hey " everyone in LP is scum no one cares " xD
Agree , if they leave the game they should get + 1 game
Is this my bank manager . Shit breh
no
Do nt know if this has been posted , but if someone leaves before you you wo nt get games added on if you leave .
I thought it did this already . Maybe I m confused with LoL .
why do you people keep doing this valve followed by a comma shit , why ca nt you just write " suggestion " or " feedback " or " mechanic idea "
How does one even get to LPQ ? You need to have the worst Internet or cry a second river every game .
Cant wait for next RTC abandon .
I think there should be another level of low priority . super low priority .
People just report you when they disagree with you . Not when you re actually abusing anything !
you can only gift item once you know .
Make it impossible to gift or trade while you have unplayed low prio games .
Hell No ! My friend needs 3 weeks just to get over from 3 Low Prior matches , pls dont make it worse
" friend "
Stop ruining the game for everyone else if you have potato internet .
This tbh . Get better internet or gtfo to lpq .
Edit - gtfo to lol or smite instead , please .
reported muted enjoy lpq
no fuck you 5 is already too many in this new system
It should be 20 games , not only 5 .
So people with internet issues or valve server issues should remain in LP indefinitely ?
I do nt see what is so hard for people to understand about the LP system when they complain about internet issues .
It makes no difference if you abandon 10 games because you are a rage quitting loser , or if you abandon 10 games because you do nt have a good enough internet connection . You still abandoned , so you go to LPQ .
So not much I can do about that . I moved out a couple years ago , but at the time really not much to do about it .
No one has a problem understanding , that 's not even what we re talking about .
No one has a problem understanding ?
Still not that , try again .
lemonloaff has a point . you on the other hand sound like a mad kid
I was just pointing out that OP 's proposed " fix " will put a lot of players to lp for reasons beyond their reach ie valve server issues .
if you have a shit internet connection you cant play dota . simple as that .
As far as I know you do nt get 5 games in LP because of internet or server issues , unless you are abandoning like 3 games in a day .
There were hundreds of people complaining here last month that they were getting abandons + LP due to valve servers being not stable .
As long as your account is in decent standing , you should nt get LP or at least more than one game of LP . One game of LP is nt that bad . But if you are still trying to play dota and you know your internet or server is shitty , that 's messed up to the other ppl you are playing with . IMO , you deserve LP at that point .
Probably similar people to those who get chat banned for " no reason .
Probably , no way to check or prove really
where is that 9k redditor lp hate bot when you need it
They should just remove the cap on the amount of LP games someone can have .
That 's actually counter - intuitive . If they re stuck there forever , they have no incentive to stop ruining games . There 's literally no point for them to stop once they re there .
It makes it easier to win for people who can play a lot of heroes .
it really does nt . I am stuck with 4 random people that are in low priority for various reasons . if I get a low impact hero and everyone else picks a carry , we lost .
50 % of the people win 100 % of the time .
Nobody wins if one team abandons in Low Priority .
and you are wrong btw . have had 2 games now where the other team is losing , one player abandons and they all quit so we do nt get credit for the win .
How frequently do you abandon games ? I ll dump a game per month or so because I m a salty motherfucker who hates dota and I ve never been in LP .
That seems just a bit man power intensive for a company that has less than 400 employees .
Yeah , I was highlighting the idea that the change is dumb . Low priority should be 3 games , win or loss . It 's already punishment enough having to endure that .
Get low low , create another account account
Perfect . They ca nt play ranked for over a hundred games then . Even more punishment than if they stuck out low priority .
How is not playing ranked games a punishment ?
no , you shouldnt so you shitstains are kept there forever




























In the old days , Dota had an option that you could avoid parties when playing solo . Why the hell this has been removed ? It 's really not fair when playing Solo Ranked .
test
wtf the voice changes depending on the length :


I like , one
: D
We will be watching your posting career with great interest .
confirmation bias . people who already have this idea in their head will actively always blame the party for their loss even if 2 solo players were just as likely to have " thrown " the game or whatever
My " bias " comes from the fact that I , one of those players people complain about when I stack with friends .
I have also been on the receiving end of that when I tryhard while solo queuing . So I know I would nt want to be matched with myself in a party .

I also play lots of solo MMR where there will be a bunch of idiots who dont give a fuck and are super toxic and barely try and this is in the 4 . 5 - 5k bracket .
The only legitimate complaint about this is that a guy could be 6k solo and 3K party and just absolutely shit on everyone , that is a real issue , next thread like this , complain about that .
And when i queue and my mate feeds i ll flame him to all hell cz i want to win . i ll make sure he never picks pudge again . that 's just me i guess , but if that 's not how people operate , they can expect to lose party mmr to the point where it doesnt matter that they badly because everyone around them is of the same " level "
You need to understand that if someone dicks around in stacks just because its party mmr or whatever , they will lose party mmr to the point where they maintain a 50 % winrate , which in effect means they re not the ones losing you the game .
And my solo mmr is over 1k higher than my party mmr ( mainly because i dont play party that often , but I ve never had serious issues with a stack any more often than I would have had with 2 random solo queuers in their place )
If you think that removing parties from solo ranked queues would increase your mmr , you re clearly delusional since it 's a 0 sum game as far as mmr is concerned - everyone ca nt gain mmr since someone has to lose the mmr you re supposedly gaining .
I personally have had more than enough games where a huge difference mmr party and the lower mmr picks mid / carry and is completely useless whole game and has 0 farm . Or on the other side when the really high mmr player just totally shits on the opposing team and finishes the game like 25 - 2 .
Not just you , tons of people just need someone to blame when they lose so they blame the parties .
I was 2 stack ranked a lot . About 75 % of the time we queue with a 3 stack . The other 25 % we get 3 solos .
Lucky
majority of games in 4k mmr in aus i ve found have party .
maybe 1 in 30 i ve played have been ruined by party
about 1 in 5 have been ruined by a child crying because he did nt get mid
I rather have 5 minute search time than have a 30 minute shitty game
its not the solo queue timings that would be shit but those 2 man stacks would have impossible queue times since they can only be matched with 3 man stacks
If it is that bad then why not just remove being allowed to 3 stack ? Does LoL still allow queuing ranked with 3 ? I know HotS does nt . Like , why would you sit in a queue for 50 minutes ? What do you do for that 50 minutes ? What party MMR are you matching ?
Like , serious questions , not judging you or being sarcastic . Just curious .
If solo que is made as an option like before there will be plenty of solo players that prefer the shorter que times and they can match with them as well .
Except it did nt take that long when we had it before with a much smaller community size . When it was added there was ZERO noticeable difference for anybody . I feel like everyone against this did nt actually play when they released it before and are just making shit up out of fear .
you have to realize that matchmaking and the player base in general has changed a LOT since then . earlier the system basically did not consider skill level while matchmaking , and everyone was low - skilled enough that it did nt matter and games were nt horribly imbalanced . Now , even with say ~ 100 - 200 average mmr difference between teams would lead to complete stomps most of the time . that 's why they give + 45 / 5 mmr .
So we have this added constraint that stacks the system matches must be very close in mmr ( AND in mmr distribution - 2 4ks is not the same as 1 3k + 1 5k )
Additionally , for whatever reason , the number of 2 stacks now > number of 3 stacks , and this was not necessarily the case earlier . So you really ca nt simply expect the system to " go back to how it was " That 's just not how it works . Valve is nt completely stupid .
Yeah stopped reading after that . No need for personal attacks , have a nice day .
or you can get another friend to become 3 man stack since you like playing with your friends in the first place .
thats fine . find your own randoms to play with if you do nt want to wait
you may think thats fine since you obviously have no friends and never stack , but if valve actually implemented this and people had to wait 1 hour to find a game as a duo , dota 2 would no longer exist as a game . im sure " thats fine " by you too .
Good god how many times do i have to repeat this :

solution : dont q ranked with ur two stack , fuck off to normal mm .
Actually on average 40 minutes ,
Ehh , most of my blowout games have been under 30 .
What rating are you at to have 5 minute queue times ?
Valve should think in a solution that impact in both Party and Solo MMR when a player is in a party ( to prevent boosting ) or just rework the Party MMR ( maybe something like CSGO ?
Actually trios would get shorter queues . Currently trios can only get matched with duos and since duos would only be able to get matched with trios , trios would get a shorter time .
Also it d be impossible to play with a friend in a simple duo queue game if we were to remove / separate them from solo matchmaking im sure you do nt want that . Just because you dont have a good solution doesnt mean you should dismantle and completely destroy a maybe flawed but functional system that we have in place already .
majority of the player base mostly plays unranked ?
While we re at add All Draft Mode as well considering the amount of support it has gotten from the community .
85 % might want to check the upvote percentage for this thread
Pretty sure this post is full of shit and the majority DON T want this solo queue returned . I m happy with the current matchmaking system but you do nt see me making posts or polls about it because why would I .
There might be a lot of people that do nt care because they do nt really realize what the problem is with stacks in solo ranked games or did nt really look into it or are just casual players and do nt wanna care about games being balanced , but bringing back solo queue would nt hurt these players at all since they do nt care , everyone is free to use that option or not , sooo yeah , definitely something that the community in general wants .
.
You dont make posts or polls about something you are happy and content with .
was nt that the exact point he just made .
That was the point , friend .
They can always queue on unranked MM .
i dont recall ever having that long of a wait time back when solo q was a thing .
well for whatever reason , the player base has changed enough since then that the number of 2 stacks > number of 3 stacks . Also , back then no one really " knew " how to play and skill levels were all very low so you could match any 2 stack with any 3 stack and it would nt lead to horribly imbalanced games . there 's just not enough same - skilled parties queueing at the same time for this to be viable .
i already wait 30mins - 1hr in party
Well u d wait even longer then GG
In my personal experience , there is nt more people whining and flaming in ranked than unranked . People tryhard more for sure , but they flame just as much , i feel maybe even less because since they want to win more they are making a bit more efforts to stay positive for some , not sure . I think i am anyway , if i tryhard in ranked i ll still try to encourage my negative team and make us work together , in unranked i d just mute everyone and would nt be willing to try playing with a team that does nt wanna play .
As for the language , i almost never get anyone that does nt speak english in my ranked , they are always in the other team , in unranked on the other hand , i m with a russian stack super commonly .
Maybe you take it more personally or pay more attention to it when you play ranked , but i honestly do nt feel this is true at all . The best games i had in terms of working with your team and atmosphere were always in ranked , with people that acknowledge the fact that everyone in the team is as good and we re all trying to win , it sure is rare , but it only happened to me in ranked .
I m on US East , so I get south americans almost constantly . It 's very frustrating to play with them .
If you live in Australia like me , queue times would be ridiculously long if solo Q was added .
I live in Australia , not sure what you re talking about . Queue times are usually around a minute or two .
Thats odd , pubs is about 1 - 4 minutes for me . Ranked a lot longer , are you in the mmr trench like me ?
Ranked has been instant the last few days . Unranked takes a couple of minutes . My ranked is 3 . 8k and my unranked is somewhere in Normal Skill bracket .
Can confirm queue time isnt over 5 mins on 4k bracket aus
in b4 omg valve solo q wait too long
Valve please hear the community : Im fine with it .
Reddit 's logic :
When a party is on my team - No one takes party MMR seriously and throws Volvo plz fix "
When a party is on the enemy team - OMG why am I forced to play against people with party MMR that 's so much lower than their solo MMR Volvo plz fix "
I do think that the party MMR needs to be reworked somewhat , but people who seriously complain about it are just looking for any excuse for their losses .
No , people complain that they , not because they might be losing , but because its unfair for people caring about their solo mmr , when the 2 party team will be affected through their party mmr instead .
Its not about losing or winning , its about a , match .
Both teams will have a 2 - person party in them . Both teams will be equally affected by " the 2 party team will be affected through their party mmr instead " Seems fair to me .
It 's fair in the long run , but it makes unbalanced games , because some stack wo nt give a shit , and some other will put a super underrated player stomping mid without the other team can do ANYTHING about it .
Whether you get a free win or a guaranteed loss , the game 's not interesting and party mmr / stacks are the reason for it .
It just does nt make any sense mathematically to mix two different mmr systems in the same game , that 's it .
I agree that the party MMR system probably needs tweaking ( though I imagine it 's a quite difficult problem to solve ) and does make for higher variance of games , but the fact that I see people complaining so much about it makes me feel like it 's just another scapegoat for their own failings .
If they removed the party indicator , the problem would almost certainly go away .
I m not saying the current system is perfect , but people complain about it , as if it 's the worst thing ever .
I guess it depends how much you play ranked and how much you run into it . When you run into it every other day it keeps the problem pretty fresh in your mind .
I think Valve might never bring back solo queue , but there 's gotta be a way to improve the current system .
Well maybe you feel this way , and you re even surely right for some people , but that 's not really what we re talking about here .
And OP did nt even once said that he 's losing mmr because of stacks or anything , he 's just stating fact and he 's right .
How is this any different from smurf accounts ?
How is this similar in any way ?
Smurfs have an accurate solo mmr and are matched according to it .
Exactly .
Eventually though unless there is intentional feeding involved both cases will eventually end up where they belong .
The fact that people care more or less about party mmr is not the root of the problem .
There is a reason why people do nt care about party mmr and it 's because it 's inherently biased , even if people cared about it .
If you make a smurf and you do nt care , well you ll play according to it and have a solo mmr according to it . So maybe you do nt care much about your smurf mmr , but it 's still an accurate representation of how well you do when you do nt care .
Except that the algorithm does nt take into account solo MMR . So you could have two parties , both a 4 . 5k and a 3 . 5k in a 4k game . But one party has a 5k solo player that goes mid and dominates , whereas the party on your team has 4k solo and 3k solo and they both pick roaming enchantress doom and dive enemy towers all game .
But , then that 5k solo mmr wins a lot of games , and party MMR increases ?
" Oh my party mmr is too high now , I ll just fuck around until it goes down "
Then you get the opposite problem where people do nt care about the game and go " oh it 's just party mmr " and dive towers and pick ridiculous things ( like mid dagon chen or rapier rush ember )
That sounds more like a smurf account .
The system takes players ' behaviour into consideration ? Please , stop talking out of your ass and share your sources .
In short , if you have a behavior that are preventing your team from winning , you will on average loose more games and your MMR will drop .
exactly that .
Always confused , why does party MMR matter and solo does nt ? I ask as a person who does nt give a shit about his solo or party MMR .
It 's pretty obvious dude . Friends can smurf and boost your party MMR , higher ranked friends can carry you as the strongest player in the game , you can queue with 4 friends way better than you and get boosted . The list goes on and on , but it 's pretty clear that party mmr is in no way a good indicator of skill , while everybody is fighting on a relatively even battlefield in solo .
When you do those things , does nt on average , the enemy team also get a party doing that also ?
No . the whole point of getting boosted by a smurf is that you have a guy who is 5k playing on his 3k smurf . It 's highly unlikely that the other team has this arrangement every single game . You can look at smurf winrates and tell that it 's obviously an extreme advantage in raising mmr .
You know , your higher ranked friends could also just boost your solo mmr .
Again , if , then that logic gives neither team an inherent advantage .
That just goes to show that the people who rave against this do nt even play the game . For you and everyone who upvoted this : if there 's a party on one team , there 's a party on the other one as well . There 's never just one party in ranked . Why are you even posting this if you do nt play , and why do you guys all have opinions if you do nt even play solo ranked .
Does not fucking matter . The problem is not having parties on one or both team , the problem is that having parties on any or both teams can , and usually will , make the game unbalanced .

Please hear the community . We are sick of this stupid ass thread being posted 10 times a week . Stop posting the same damn thread every fucking day k thx .
so what is the match making algorithm supposed to do with a team of four ?
the weekly thread , nice
Hello sir it is me your 6k mmr solo and 3k mmr party : Kappa :
One day we got matched against a Earth Spirit player who had 3 . 7k party mmr but his solo was 4 . 8k .
either blame the hero for your loss or the player that outplayed you , not both lol .
I m just wondering why there are different mmr for solo and party . Can someone explain that to me ?
I , it 's because the playstyles are very different among the two . In solo , you go in with a mindset to perform your personal best , whereas in party you try to synergise well and put more emphasis on the teamwork . Also , it is possible to carry someone in a party to higher MMR and thus boost them , when hey go queue alone with higher skill groups they will perform worse ( i . e . less boosters )
And its kinda annoying to queue as 5 and have 5k average party and then play against a team with 4 . 5k party average but all of them have 6k solo and get - 44 eventho the enemy team is better .
" Its possible to carry someone in party to higher mmr than they have " Is just not a valid point , since you will always play against an enemy stack with around the same average mmr .
Yeah . A 5k with a 3k burden will stomp the 2 4ks 90 % of the time . This is a very unbalanced matchup .
That is actually not true . A 3k player will probably be just as much of a burden for the team as the 5k will be an advantage . How do i know this ? I ve played with a 3k friend and we have around 57 % winrate together over 400 games , my overall winrate is 53 %
No it 's nothing to do with the mindset , you need to synergise with your team in both solo and party if you wanna win dota . It 's just about an individual mmr not meaning anything when in parties that people chose and with players of different skills , so they figured it 's better to have a garbage party mmr that means nothing so that solo mmr still means something , only problem is they still mix the two of them for some reason because poor dual stacks need to wait one more minute to ruin solo rank games when they could simply play unranked .
This response has the correct amount of salt for the reddit standards . I like it .
You need to go back in time to when there was no ranked and there was solo queue .
MMR is not based on performance , but rather the result of the match . Therefore , if you queue with another player he may dramatically affect the result , which in turn drives change to your MMR regardless of you .
Here we are are now . People playing ranked got fed up with parties . Valve , already removed 4man parties from ranked . Let 's see what happens next .
Well my point is that it would be more even if 6k solo players would have 6k party aswell . Since a 6k solo player is probably better than the average 4k party player eventho he has 4k party mmr .
I dont see how ones skill would vary depending on if you play with friends or alone . Most people who frequently play solo and party will end up with around the same mmr in both - unless your solo mmr is higher than 5k .
Because at 4 . 5 - 5k party mmr there are a lot of players ( perhaps even a majority ) who have 5 . 9 - 6 . 2k solo mmr but 4 . 4k party and thus it will be hard for you to gain mmr with your 5k average party .
But eventho the enemy team has 500 lower party mmr than us their solo mmr is just as high or even higher resulting in us either getting + 5 or - 45 against a team that is equal to us
Now why do we have higher party mmr than them ? Because we play more party and less solo than them . If they wanted to their party could also be 4 . 9k average but they just havnt put the games into it .
Now i do understand that there is some kind of line where a party of 2 or 3 would be able to win a very high percentage of their games by bringing in a lower mmr friend . Where this line is i dont know . All i know is that if we had only one mmr it wouldnt matter since the mmr would still balance around where their actual skill is compared to everyone else .
If there was only 1 mmr , so that you would have 4900 solo and party . Your opponents wouldnt be on such a low average that you would easily win the games .
I am part of the community as well , so hear me now : There will be no solo queue . Thanks Valve , love ya .
Oh look this thread again .
It will exist as long as it is needed .
It 's not needed though . People are just blaming shit on stacks .
thanks for this thread again
99 . 9 % of the time you have a party on your team , so does the other team .
Really wish RLewis would choke the rest of you crybabies out
They removed it because the seperate queues caused issues with matchmaking .
The queue times increased massively when valve implemented seperate queues .
I support this thread .
I would pay money for a Dota where I can actually solo queue . You hear that Volvo , take more of my money ! Its yours . Please just deliver Dota 3 : A Solo Match Making Experience .
sure , always the others
Every single day some idiot create this thread . Can you shut the fuck up already ? I ve never had a party ruining games because it is a party mmr . So stop whining like a little shit .
Dear lord .
You absolutely cannot have a 4 stack on your team if you are solo queuing a ranked game .
And if you are talking about unranked , it is not going to change because no one seriously expects a solo queue for unranked now , do they ?
They are listening to the community , these threads get downvoted into oblivion every time because they re stupid .
the reason they are downvoted is because people post them every 2 days , but some of them usually make them to the front page
Exactly , they dont get downvoted because people dont want solo q , they get downvoted because people get fed up with the same thread every day . But then again , Im glad people keep making this thread , just for the hope of Valve actually doing something about it .
Yeah right , that 's why you make it to the front page by just saying " volvo pls giff solo queue back " every day .

I still disagree .
Most of the community does nt give a shit about it .
The community is goddamn stupid and valve should only listen to it when it makes sense .
Just here saying that we should nt ranked party no more . Vote + 1

If you are downvoting or against this , you are totally fucking retarded .
No ? this has nothing to do with the party performing good or not ? Can you read ?
stfu
It 's pretty clear why they will not do this guys . They joined the queues because there was nt enough people . Now there is less people , they wo nt split the queues .
how about all the idiots with their shit - tier stacks q regular mm , not ranked .
I do nt want solo queue back . I do nt want to wait forever to find a group because people like you think that somehow having a stack on either team is making the game worse for them . Why on earth do you think that 4 random ( to you ) people playing together is any worse than 4 completely random people ?
If only that was the only problem , but it 's even more about party mmr being a joke and being used to balance real solo queue games .
because parties can be 2k mmr apart , thus making for a very unbalanced game . Their solo mmr can be way above , or way below their party mmr . Imagine a game where one team has a stack that is close together in party mmr and their solo is 500 higher . The other side has a team whose party mmr is 1500 apart and in both cases their solo mmr is well below their party mmr . Going to be such a balanced and fun game .

" Do it " and " Do it well " are different things . You may not like it , but he is actually good at picking and presenting stats , and on camera too .
Yes they are fairly seperate . I dont think he is saying u need to be an econ prof to do dota stats

thx for your suggestion . I ll check it out :
I tried emulating both the Wii and the PS2 version using dolphin and PCSX2 respectively and the Wii version had lots of visual glitches within the first few minutes whereas the PS2 version ran perfectly fine with only the visual celestial brush canvas effect missing . So really , if you plan on emulating the PS2 version is a lot better imo .
But It could work on CM with , set .
I definitely feel like she would if you do the face right . Everything else seems like it will fit right in . I personally think that Axe would be quite the sight to see though .

I really want to play okami now .
play it on wii or wii u , much better than when I played it on ps2
If you have a PS3 , you can also download Okami HD and play it in 1080p
I have , but nothing matches using the wiimote as the celestial brush and drawing the powers ;
If you have a PC , you can download Dolphin and play in 1080p with a wiimote

Oh wow that looks awesome ! And Okami is a great game .
Is it just a secondary black mesh with normals inverted ?
Yep exactly this . Had to copy the weights ( and tweak some broken areas ) of the outline to the rig as well so it follows the animation
Man , Okami was such a wonderful gem for its time . Good work !
What software did you use ?
I do nt even play DOTA any more , got here from , but this is awesome . You just put my favorite hero and one of my favorite games of all time together , and it worked out beautifully !
One of the game called Okami .
This is the greatest thing ever . There 's no game that I want more than a new Okami .
Looking good ! What did you use to make it ?
I ' ve no idea what is okami style . But i like it .
Do Io !
To make the outline mesh to the joints of the animation xD As a huge Okami fan , I m loving this .
It is a bit similar to the joints of the game called Okami .

can we get a whole mod for this ? like everything is in this style ? all heroes etc ? id pay 50 $

I have nt been able to test this on a hero because it 's difficult .
I m not sure . The Dota 2 wiki specifically says that units are killed when they are below threshold , and that units are nt killed when they are above the threshold , but it does nt specifically mention what happens when the HP is exactly at the threshold . It could be a bug with creeps .
I posted the exact description in another comment . It does nt say it has to be below the threshold .
Not if your max hp is 550 , though
oh I did nt see that you used it on a creep . I think that 's a bug then .
has to be below the threshold , no ?
This is the exact description of the ability . Does nt mention that the hero has to be below the threshold .
I guess they assumed people would read that as obviously below .
550 is not strictly less than 550 , though
I posted this solely because this cost me a kill .
But you only get the speed if you kill a hero ?
This is incorrect .




























Simply , this is a calling to all those players who similarly like to do 1v1s or just want to show their ability in a solo tournament .

There ? Where ?
I saved that tweet just in case he finishes last on the next TI
Could someone explain this double tax thing ? So they had to pay income tax to China and USA and tried to avoid it ? Does anyone know how they did it then ?
Very basic general explanation :
Source means that the source of the money was in a certain territory . So all money that is sourced in a territory is liable to be taxed by that territory . The DAC winnings are sourced in China hence liable to Chinese income tax .
do you know how much the double tax would ve cost them ?
Yes
well would nt the tax rates be different for Residence and Source ?
Depends on the rates and tax breaks they may receive . It would be steep I imagine though especially in China .
Yeah I imagine it had to have been steep especially if EG was willing to fight it this long to avoid . Just wanted to know exactly how steep it would ve been .
Yeah of course , I m not sure if they d get away with 0 but I m sure they have been offered a tax break as the winnings would have no doubt been paid directly to the business no the individual . By heavily taxing them it would put teams and companies wanting to be involved in the future .
I mean I m part Russian but the disparity between even them and Asia is so big .
Also did they managed to find a way in the end ?
:
,
Apparently Charlie smuggled it out of China by converting it into gold bricks and painfully inserting each bullion into his anus like Papillion in Henry Charriere 's novel , this way avoiding taxes both in China and the US . He managed to pass the metal detectors by bribing the security with EG wristbands and promises for mod status in RTZ 's channel
Someone knows why did they must wait so much time ?
EG tried to figure out how to recieve the money without pay double taxes .
The solution was to kick AUI
At least Charlie forced China to buy an MKB .

You mean EG either finally figured out how to avoid the double tax , or just decided to eat the double tax .
What would we do without this thread ?
You do nt understand , it 's not DAC 's fault
You do nt understand !

xD post it again !
Now you can get back to play dota ppd
Just in time for DAC version 2 . 0 . Kappa
Will they give AUI his cut or keep it for the org ?
are you fucking stupid ?
no I just do nt know how it works but thank you for explaining
I actually thought the same . but just thinking randomly , what if at some point is org that is registered instead of the players ? that would be scary for the players .
It would come down to the contract between the player and the organization .
Thank God I can finally sleep at night !
Still not DAC emotes .
DAC emotes are out since the middle of the year . That awesome sandking emote Kreygasm
Is it possible that some people never received them ? I do nt have them , and I have the compendium
That would explain it then . I have nt seen any info on it on the wiki and assumed they were available for everyone .
I think you should recheck it in - game . I thought i also didnt received it after reading your comment but is in my list of emotes .
gotta be above a certain compendium level
You mean
TIL DAC emotes is riki taking invisibility runes
" Finally paid " unless they were lying before the reason it took time was to cheat current tax rules .

Shitposting is making this subreddit more creative .
All these shitposts are not only unique , but also built on ,
Think about past aghs upgrades . They introduced new mechanics to the game while staying true to the lore :
Things we consider to be normal in Dota 2 ( spellsteal , 5 - second cd blink , 4 - second AOE disable , global silence , etc . would be absurd in League of Legends . Think about that difference .
2 weeks ? Was an announcement made ?
It will all be worth it . All those months of shitposting .
It will all end soon .
Now that its just 2 weeks , can we have your pre - release guides ? Not a DotA1 player . I m very curious . PM me . Thanks .
Can only do post - release , sorry .
But . But I want to ruin pubs as soon as he comes out . _ .
Split push them to death .
The hero needs Midas + other items .
It is up to you what these other items are .
The sf one had an ags that increased max souls but as your number of souls increased your move speed decreases and your range increases , until you became an immobile shadow tower . You could then be carried around by your teammates if they had enough strength .
That was beautiful . Too bad I missed the thread .
You missed out , dude . Those were some dank shitposts .
The Shadow Tower one was close to being a pocket Riki .
save us mr lizard
Pls mr lizard
I can confirm , since I started shitposting I gained 25 mmr .
Shitposts have given me more game knowledge than actually asking about them . Go figure .
It seems like shitposting is starting earlier and earlier in the life cycle of a patch . Soon we will reach " pocket riki " levels of shitposting minutes after a new balance patch is released .
Im pretty new 2 this Reddit , somebody plz explain y people shitpost at the end of patches , or is it just boredom ?
You are cancer OP keep on shitposting




























for answering . If you ca nt understand an answer I will describe it there :
I really ca nt figure out if is more easy to balance a support hero or a carry . Maybe the support are more easy ?
As a support player I would say that I want a new carry and I am tired of getting only new support hero .
I do nt care that it 's a simple design , just give us another carry to play with .
What Icefrog wants to design is up to him . I ll repeat it clearer : I want a carry hero design that has its own unique spell , but whether it scales midgame or lategame , it does nt matter .
Can you please tell me why ES is still broken ? I ve yet to hear a good argument lately as to why he 's broken , especially this patch , that ca nt be dealt with by small changes or by just drafting the right heroes or using the right playstyles .
Support are more easy to design , basically you do this :
Ranged
Int .
Yes .
I can agree , I really want a new carry that will kill me instantly or I will survive for 4 sec if I have the ghost scepter .
I do nt see why this exaggeration is useful at all
I think you re underestimating the complexity of supporting .
Agreed - Bit boring having none of the new heroes in Captain 's Mode because of their incredibly over - complicated mechanics making them too awkward to balance . I m not saying it 's an entirely bad thing but I would nt mind some more basic heroes or at least as basic as the likes of Slark and Medusa .
I d say there 's a reason earth spirit and oracle are among the last heroes ported
He got a techies flair for a reason .
Like Pocket Riki , that makes the game unique
There are , hidden in classic DotA .
of course something unique would be nice , there are way too many int heroes so i guess another strength or agility support could nt hurt
Please not another Earth Spirit




























anyone else having this issue ?
client works fine though .
thx




























Max movement speed increase / decrease : 25 % or 50 ms . Still not too sure on the numbers )
At 0 % difference Morphling 's movement speed stays the same as his current base movement speed ( 285 base ms )
This is intended to buff agility carry morphling by making him more mobile and making adaptive strike less likely to be disjointed while not buffing offlane morphling . It wo nt fix all of his problems but I thought it would be a nice change for him . Thoughts ?
In this land of scepter shitposts . this idea will probably get lost in the shuffle , but I do see some promise in it good sir .
yea REAL original . fuck you .
no
Nice idea . It can also give options for escaping in choosing whether to up agi for speed or strength for durability .
That movement speed debuff on strength morph will probably do more harm than good for the carry build . I do nt think people realize how often Morphling changes between agility and strength during fights . It would be a death sentence to ever morph strength during a gank or a losing battle .
Projectile speed changes would be solid though .
Further distance on wave would do it
Yeah that would do it , the numbers on it are difficult though . Since you re still dealing with a 235 base movement speed hero then .
Just wanted to shed some light on this adaptive strike projectile thing since I see a lot of people talking about ways to buff morphling recently .
Also , while your idea is interesting , keep in mind that ether blast projectile moves at a speed of 1200 , so if you used a max agi adaptive strike , it would have the possibility of landing before the ether form affects your target , which will reduce your nuke damage by 40 %
On a side note
I do really like the movement speed idea though . Never thought water could be so slow O . o
e - blade magic resistance decrease applies instantly , damage applies on projectile hit
test it yourself
I just tested it and did nt see the enemy 's magic resist drop to - 4 % until the projectile hit . I know the ethereal form is applied before the damage , but it is applied once the attack connects , not when it is launched .
i feel this is okay , with octarine strength morph has been indirectly buffed , so if you buff morph as a whole , it could come back . the alternative is making strength morphling viable without making him the best disabler in the game and a pain in the ass to play against
What do you mean by this ?
i mean " octarine , strength morph " P i forgot a comma
Morphling utilizing octarine core and his strength morph .
But why is that significant ? Does Octarine make Morph faster ? Or is it just that it uses less mana ?
With octarine morph has something like a 4 . 5 sec stun on 7 sec cd with str morphed - hes talking about the playstyle of offlane utility / stun morph .
Seems kinda expensive and gimmicky though . Could you really call that alternative playstyle a buff ?
That was literally the meta for a while . Well , Octarine did nt exist back then but people still did it , and no one bought anything after their core so Octarine would have been just fine in that build .
People did it when his stun was nt absolute shit . Any hero with dagger , bkb or some kind of magic immunity can dodge it . That 's like over half the hero pool . If abaddon , omni , jugger , slark , lifestealer are in the team , forget it .
Octarine is the gimmick , are morph stun machine with euls is totally legit .
I think it makes him morph much faster is all
Pretty sure it does nt do anything at all to morph , it 's for the stun cd reduction .
oh
well thats
Do you want me to read you octarine cores stats ?
The MS buff works nicely , the issue is the adaptive strike speed increase . Right now the shotgun combo works so that both move at the same speed ( I think , or at least they re close enough ) that you can easily execute an adaptive strike while they re ethereal just by casting one straight after another . This change would actually make it harder to hit the combo in its most effective form , so would be more of a nerf than a buff when the shotgun combo is in use at least .
Personally I feel like anything that adds base movespeed ( buff wise ) will be really hard to balance . If the meta shifts back to farming late game heroes morph may already be in a good spot as is . Idk , I just think with a meta shift then added movespeed he just becomes imba . If they plan on staying with this current setup of creep gold being shit in comparison to getting kills then maybe . Im by no means an expert though so who knows .
I came here to see shitposts , not actual suggestions .
Just change the fucking ult . It 's 10 times worse than ember 's remnants
Ember 's is still way better but morph has some really cool things you can do .
How do you get this ? You ca nt control Remnants , you ca nt have them move across the map as you farm / push a lane , you ca nt have them bait enemies , you ca nt have them attack , remnants ca nt tank tower damage , remnants do nt last as long as Replicate does , etc .
What advantage does Remnant have over Replicate ? Many would say you can use it on the fly to escape over terrain , but Waveform already does this . There 's really no reason to change his ult , it 's ridiculously powerful when used properly .
Morphling 's pretty good for early game in terms of hard carry , though he is still easily outclassed . Mid game he falls waaay behind , but starts to snowball extremely hard if he gets farm . The best way to bring him back is to help him get that farm a bit easier . Movement speed , attack range , base damage , mana costs , etc are his main weaknesses , so buffing a few of them could potentially make him viable , but this is VERY dependent of the meta .
" you can bait enemies " maybe in 2k pubs , and are there supports that deal pretty well with illusions
" you ca nt have them attack , ca nt tank tower damage " a slight advantage still worthless when compared to the mobility remnants offer
" remnants do nt last as long " well having 3 charges , lower cd , and they do nt dissapear on death
Replicate is outdated , admit it 's a pretty bad ult .
A slight advantage ? If you replicate a tanky hero you can essentially push a tower while the creeps attack the other creeps . By the time the replicate dies , the tower is already dead , and your team has taken NO tower damage . Not at all a " slight advantage .
Also , how do you think Remnants give more mobility ? You can throw them over terrain ? Waveform already does that , so Remnants have no mobility advantage over Morphling . Morphling has advantages over Ember in terms of mobility , as you can walk your Replicate to the other side of the map for a REALLY effective split push . This is extremely valuable .
Replicate is nt outdated , you re just being stubborn and / or not giving it the credit it deserves , or maybe you do nt understand how to use it properly . I ca nt say which it is without watching you play Morph , but it could easily be all of the above .
they re not the same hero though .
You do realize ember has better laning , better scaling , and better escape , right ? He 's basically superior to morph in every way except morph has some stupid gimmicky bullshit with aghs
all it will take is a little buff .
ember 's remnants are probably the best ulti in the game so that 's not saying much
Ember is super super fine right now !
numbers probably need to get tweaked , but it 's a pretty good idea
Good idea . Makes him more unique too and gives a much needed buff to the frustration that is current agi morphling .
It 's a good buff for him . Hope he get more picks on next patch .
Pretty solid . I like it
Morph being one of my favs for a long time , I was always wondering what we could come up with to bring him back yet keep balance . This is actually fucking brilliant . WP
I have no issues with Morphling buffs .
Yeah but remember Tinker ? Fuck that guy .
Other , much stronger mids got buffed in the meantime tho , so we wo nt see the cancer of Tinker being picked every single game .
Still , fuck that guy .
I think a base movespeed buff + the MS change for morph is the way to go .
50 ms seems really strong . That would put him at base 335 ms ( tied for highest in the game ) Movement speed is kind of difficult to judge the value of , but 50 seems like way too much .
there could be a flat cap at each level so that you ca nt reach 335 until you have 4 points in morph .
I ve suggested this before without the movespeed change and am in favor of this change as a core morphling player .
I wish the frog would just make adaptive strike instant again , but make max stun 2 seconds or something . im so sad that I cannot really enjoy or justify picking carry morph anymore due to him being overnerfed after morph offlane / support got popular .
Morph is probably my favourite agi hero and I feel like all he needs is a flat ms buff and he ll become really strong , if not straight up OP , that being said he is kinda bad right now unless you snowball in lane with waveform
I do nt like the projectile speed change . It is fine as it is now . Eblade projectile is slow .
Not broken , since the more you switch into agi , the more you are weak to burst .
If 100 % on str , you would have all the MS boost ? Kappa
In Warcraft 3 he used to be more or less dark depending on his STR / AGI ratio . I think Valve is keeping this feature for an arcana
I think this would be a more interesting idea if the projectile speed and move speed were based on 50 - difference between str / agi . and projectile speed is 50 % difference .
Where is the shitpost ?
Cool idea mr lizard please
also maybe changing morph colours when he toggle the agi - strength . so we can estimate .
no dank memes ? what the hell is going on .
I can find absolutely no downsides for this . Extremely subtle buff as well because of the balanced stats that Aghs gives which help with morphing . 10 Agi and + 10 Str )
I love the Aghanim 's idea a lot .
Just make it not disjointable like alch 's stun
Making it disjointable was the entire point of making it a projectile in the first place .
First of all , I would argue against the projectile speed increase , because that ruins the eblade combo . Instead I would play with both waveform and adaptive strike range , Adaptive strike range boosted by 25 % on full agi and - 25 % on full Str . And waveform distance the same , or inverted , though i strongly prefer the former .
So glad this got so much attention , now it 's up to IceFrog .
I d be cool if his primary attribute can swap if one is higher than the other . Imagine if aghs does that as well
An increase in movement speed on Morph would make him the absolute best hero in the game . I ca nt say I would nt want that as a Morphling fangay . But it 's a hero all you viewers will HATE to see after a few months because of how the hero works .
I love the idea of Adaptive strike being faster on carry Morphling though ! And I suppose if the MS buff is only tiny , like a 10 MS buff at lvl 4 adaptive it would nt make the hero too strong either . But I would say the idea of a MS buff to be too strong and not needed at all .
I am of the opinion that Morphling as a carry is very strong right now .
Is offlane morphling a thing ? never heard of it . but I m a 2 . 8k mmr scrub
Str morph was a reasonable offlane cos he was tank , with an escape and an almost 50 % uptime single target stun ( 4 . 25s stun , 10s cd )
It was used a lot vs Storm when he was cancer . 4 . 25s stun on him was devastating ( Used to be instant , so no projectile to disjoint )
I ll just drop , here .
Can we lower his fucking waveform mana cost please ?
We do nt need Morphling back . He already has had his time in TI2 . Maybe buff him after TI6 .

Doom ultimate deals Pure damage . Pipe blocks only magical damage .
But it states so if you alt while viewing doom 's ultimate
Seems like a long ago change , where the tooltip did nt get updated . It should nt be blocked . It 's pure and they fixed it .
In 6 . 80 or 6 . 81 the Pipe could block Doom 's damage again . Then it 's been changed to pure .
So is this the part where we call valve to remove this misleading statement ? Cause goddamn i build pipe to counter doom .
Also read , to understood all the skill that will amplify / reduce the pure damage ( and any other kind of damage )
It 's an incorrect tooltip . Lots of these have popped up in the past . Do we call them ? No but we ve made a reddit post and this may pop up in the dev forums .
I thought it blocked " spell " damage . Does nt it block things like QoP ult ? Or at least used to ?
Read the title . was hoping for shitpost .
Was disappoint .
Pipe active cannot be dispelled




























Exactly what it says in the title . Here 's how a scenario would go :
Remake will only proceed when all players on Dire ( 4 players in this case ) voted yes , and 1 player from the Radiant side .
And no , obviously pre - vote matches do not count towards your wins and losses .
This idea can still be refined and improved . I think Valve should implement this feature !
Exactly . Why not a good remake feature that will make people will care less about servers do nt always work perfectly .
LoL is actually about to try out a suggestion like this , it ll be interesting to see how well it works and if it can be used in DotA 2 .
I like the idea though , but I fear that players may try abuse it , but then again there are plenty of things to abuse already .
sounds good





























& nbsp
& nbsp
Everything else is the same .
Numbers can be changed of course but that 's the general idea of the item . Thoughts ?
good I fuckin hate evasion
mathematically useless if the evasion chance is below 35 % ignoring the bonus damage i guess .
Thanks ! Keep in mind it only reduces base damage so + raw damage is not affected at all and also the passive can proc ( static damage not like crit ) still which kinda helps .
Like i said :
Its just feels a little weird to me
Oops missed that . Thanks for the comment though .
useful for countering windranger I guess
Yea lets put PA deeper into the dumpster !
PA came to my mind instantly :
Well that hero just needs nerfs to her other abilities than her evasion
Why is PA in the dumpster ?
She 's a bad carry late game because she does nt offer a lot of damage . Phantom Strike is a huge AS boost , but does not work on magic immune enemies .
If you ca nt Phantom Strike , then you re easy to kite - in which case , Sven is a better pick because he is tankier and has a stun .
I really think people look at balance wrong . There will always be certain heroes that are better than others in more situations . However , that does nt mean PA could nt be a better choice than Sven , gyro , ember , etc in some cases . PA offers unique mobility / farming potential in lane . Just because PA is nt popular right now does nt mean she 's bad .
buff PA in other aspects .
but this will kill pa dramatically :
Change cooldown to 10 and then its gucci .
You re right . Increased the cooldown to 10 .
Thanks !
very cool idea for an item ,
I think one of the big issues is that the only item which counters evasion at the moment is MKB which 100 % counters it . The difficulty with making these too strong is that they will make PA even less viable .
I think the solution is to have 2 items , one something similar to what has been suggested here although with lower uptime , even 50 % seems a bit high to me . The other item should be a support item which decreases evasion by some percent .
You could even say we need a Solar Crest . Check the 6 . 84 patch notes m8 .
RIP PA , solar crest
That or increase the orb of evasion price and balance it out with a higher evasion rate ( if making butterfly ) or lower recipe costs ( crest )
It looks like people really hate WR evasion , what i do nt really understand , because it is not permanent . It is pretty obvious , when you should aa her and when not .
Yes please . I honestly think MKB needs a rework . Nothing else in the game is as much of a hard counter as MKB , and it 's both irritating to build and irritating to have built against you .
Make it work like MoM instead . When you activate you get truestrike temporarily but you take x % more damage . Possibly it even slows yourself for x seconds and / or reduces your own armour .
Not only does this give intelligence a supports a useful item to counter evasion with , but more importantly allows heroes like Silencer or OD to have a means of dealing with evasion that does nt require them to waste an entire slot on item bonuses they do nt want .
Thoughts ?
MKB is already too cheap .
I think people do nt understand how evasion is supposed to work . The items that grant evasion , mainly talisman , is supposed to be a cost effective way to increase EHP . It does nt grant stats or armor meaning countering evasion completely means removing 100 % of an items effective EHP value unlike armor or stats . Thus the item is only valuable until a counter is picked up . If the counter was easy to get , then talisman becomes less and less valuable .
Side note to close , you re really nerfing PA ?
a 3k item to counter a 1 , 8k item , seems legit to me .
That 's the point , it completely counters 100 % of the items value , hp will always be there , armor will also always have value , evasion , as soon as you get mkb , is completely removed .
u just created a new item ! very wp and good concept
This post has been made roughly three times now , all basically the same , just different names .
Miss mechanic should ve been removed from dota long ago .
All existing miss passives / abilities / items are unreliable , annoying and are often overpowered .
Like you can kill PA in 3 hits or in 15 .
seems like a shit idea
For this i got an aghanims idea for Ursa :
whenever ursa hits pandabear ursa gains fury
for each stack ursa get 10 % damage bonus
at 10 stacks ursa turns into Misha gaining 1k hp and instantly killing any pandabear on the map
Misha can throw pocket riki to catch any pandas created after misha transform , if caught that panda is now locked on your faction and has to fight against his former mates Riki dies and gives gold to misha by doing so
* misha and pandas cannot evade

Yes . He said that scorched earth caused the aggro




























Calling it now this is the new skinny tiny




























I figured the reason for this was because Puck can also use it to reposition itself which led me to this idea :

Maybe not an even split but maybe something like 100 mana cost for Orb and 50 mana cost for Jaunt ( or 120 for Orb and 30 for Jaunt )
This does nt change the drawback that Puck has compared to the meta mids right now , which is that it 's not as great in the late game , but I thought it would be a nice buff to it 's laning phase . Thoughts ?
Before the nerf , it used to be 125 / 25 .
Yeah it does nt when you think about his lore , but at the same time it kind of balances him out because Blink Dagger requires you to turn if you want to use it in the opposite direction . Puck 's escape is already ridiculous enough with that and level 4 Phase Shift anyway .
Well you can turn if you issue the command before using phase shift afaik , this is probably a factor in the reasoning
Icefrog VERY rarely reverts nerfs , he will buff something else instead .
Maybe it could cost the 150 mana to cast , but if the orb travels full distance then 30 mana is instantly restored ? Idk just an idea
Yeah , this would also solve the " Oh shit I only had enough mana to throw the orb " problem that we d probably see a lot .
I really like this idea , but is feels inconsistent . This mechanic does not exist in the game at all . BUT I understand the concern about wanting a reliable jump .
Personally I d just reduce the manacost of the main ability , and that 's it .
Medusa gets mana back for a successful snake . It 's not entirely unprecedented .
I think this this is pretty easy to implement :
edit - wording , and yea this is probably over done .
Oh , I did nt mean this was hard to implement . I know it is not .
My point was that , although I like this idea , no other skill has this behavior , and would feel confusing to users .
lel . Well , I guess I m mistaken and it 's not a bad idea to implement that .
Yep . I suggested exactly that somewhere else on this post . I think that 's what will happen . Maybe something like 90 mana cost .
I get what you re saying , it would feel like lazy balancing just creating a mechanic for one very specific interaction . Generally they change game mechanics to balance things , they do so for a lot of different things at once . Like when they changed axe spin from when the attack starts to when they hit , they did this for all similar spells as well .
OD works somewhat like that , but yeah i agree it is over complicated ,
TL
Earth Spirit flair guy talking about consistency ROFL .
What , why ? Stun , silence , dps , all that stuff exists beyond earth spirit .
And to everyone pointing out my flair , yes , I pick earth spirit 90 % of my games . FUCJ you .
( I m on mobile and the autocorrect actually suggested FUCJ . Dank as fuck )
How many other heroes have the ability to refresh existing slows / silence ?
Also you want to talk about unprecedented mechanics being in the game ? Thats what dota is all about , unique abilities that are like no other . Some are more advanced and over the top than others but regardless unique heroes is what makes dota . Also fuck you Earth Spirit picker burn in hell
Earth ca nt refresh slows / silences
He can only refresh the Magnetize DoT
Not according to reddit dude . Dota is flawed game filled with inconsistencies that need to be changed .
None of them can reset a silence .
Yeah they definitely exist on the same hero .
How about your mana regen increases by a lot when you cast the orb or something ?
I think this is a good solution with the same idea as OP . The main thing is to give it a better laning phase .
What is OP ? I have seen many redditors in this thread using it .
Thank u :
FTFY
edit : typo
90 mana too high you say , so you make it 120 instead . and 90 mana for a level 1 nuke is average or low , definitely not high .
Ah , it was a typo . I wanted to say low there .
A nice idea would be that the mana cost of Jaunt get lower from 30 / 20 / 10 / 0
That 's such a niche scenario , the situation OP described is a buff more than 99 % of the time .
Heroes like antimage , bane , pl , lion , other diff carriers , etc are nt that niche . Definitely not a niche scenario .
If bane drains your mana with the orb out , you probably would nt be jumping to it anyway .
Except you phase between orb and jaunt .
I feel like if we re going with the idea OP posted , this is one of the best solutions .
Maybe the mana should scale with the travel distance , for example , Orb costs 110 and Jaunt costs 40 the first 10 tiles , 30 the other 20 tiles , once the orb is red the Jaunt is free . What about that ?
Raises the skill ceiling , imho .
I do nt think Puck 's problem is in laning , he is a very strong laner still , he just falls off so much harder than current mids , because he is nt a true semi - carry .
Oh , absolutely . If nothing else would change , Puck would certainly need to be much stronger in the late - game . However , I d rather see other heroes have more dynamic power curve where we do nt have a couple sets of heroes for each role that are just really good at most things at most times .
good thing he can kite with ulti + slight to get an hp advantage
That 's not trading hits .
Late game you should nt be " trading blows " at all if you do nt have to , and that 's what they were talking about . The late game
That 's not laning anymore if he get his ult .
and you do nt talk about hard carries trading blows in the laning stage
Neither can some other real carries . Drow or Sniper are definitely real carries . Until you get into their face and eat it off .
I do nt play puck or even mid that much but other people have been talking about how horrible both the projectile speed and damage of puck are compared to the other popular mids . It 's fine that he does nt carry that hard but he has to at least be able to go , or better yet win his lane vs . the carry mids .
it bugs me that theres basically no point at all that puck can challenge certain mid heros
ill go even at best in lane , do only okay in the midgame and then get fucked lategame .
because he ca nt get any spamming spell ( bloodstone ) or right click items ? For example , reduce the CD for puck just like the CD for lina ; or completely change his ulti so that he can be strong offlaner ( not mid )
his ulti is actually offlaner - like one .
but it 's rare for an intelligence hero do a offlaner role
WR , Jakiro , Lich , Ogre were all fairly common offlaners at some point in competitive , not to mention Dark Seer .
Also QoP

Although I have nt watched the game , I ca nt imagine your item build was too too much of a factor with a 42 - 7 Tiny haha
Pretty much a non existing factor in fact .
Here is your summary :



,
The thing is the current meta does nt really work out for playmaking mids anymore . Before you used to see playmaking miss creating space for their carries but now since there was a nerf in creep gold , your carry will come online later and the playmaking mids fall off later in the game .
Maybe + 1 armour at start and reduce orb mana cost .
All of his skills do below average magic damage , so he does nt bring qop , lina , or ember spirit level damage to the table . If Puck kills you solo , you did something wrong . If Lina or ember kills you solo , you are nt even surprised . Puck primarily provides control through an amazing silence , and an interesting ultimate , which is usually a support role ( does nt require money , just proper use of skills , see earthshaker with blink ) but does nt bring anything to the early game , as a support , which would enable early kills , like fissure , or even early lane control \ harass , like a lich or crystal maiden .
I d rather see changes to other heroes or the game in general to make the semi carry mids weaker than see heroes like puck made to scale better .
I do nt think you understand how Dream Coil works and what it does .
Well then puck would be the perfect laner and try to get a win through dominating early to mid game , that would maybe even give the meta a few more viable strats
This might be the opportunity to take the time to ask this question . Any puck players try to jaunt to the orb only to have the command be ignored completely ? I feel like it happens at least once a game where I do nt jaunt to the orb and it causes me to miss an orb into silence .
try pressing the button harder
Works 17 % of the time .
All the time .
Happens lots , it 's a bug
It does happen to me . Have to press it like 3 times for it to work .
This actually happens to me . Either it 's a bug or we re both scrubs
I recall that being a known bug . got that for sure since S1 IIRC
I personally have nt had this happen to me .
I do use the WASD layout . so perhaps it 's a bug only present in the original keyboard layout .
I always press it more than twice for good measure .
Just lower her BAT , 1 . 5 / 1 . 6 and she can build Orchid / Mjollnir and be a semi - carry like every other mid
Queen of Puck

This is a really good idea imo , it gives Puck a bit more staying power to keep up with the meta nuke wave out farm stack / farm stacks mid heroes . Plus it adds a bit a bit of depth to a hero loved for its high skill cap .
Another thing I always suggest with these threads is a buff to this Skill . I always suggest the damage of this spell to increase with further distance traveled , but I wonder if it would be better if it were stronger & lost damage with distance traveled .
Oh & yes this seems like a great idea you have !
Damn , ca nt tell which is shitpost which is a quality post just by looking at the title , can you ?
But this is a quality one .
Edit : a few ideas .
You can cast illusory orb without turning .
Can jaunt whilst silenced .
Not suggesting all of these are applied to the hero , but the first and third I personally really like .
It used to be like this
wtf a buff idea that 's not a shitpost ?
Major buff idea for Puck 's laning : illusory orb no longer has a max range .
bounces when it reaches the end of the map
Puck can now attack during phase shift .
BAM , hero is fixed .
Seems like the best idea for a buff to the laning stage I ve seen on here , something like this might be necessary to make puck even slightly viable as a mid . Pretty sure the length of his silence has to be increased as well for him to be a mid - game presence . I m just not sure pucks issue is laning though idk seems like mids have to be able to deal some amount of physical DPS in the late game these days . Even when playing 6 . 84 storm there was the odd game he could nt carry because he does nt hit towers rax and roshan hard enough . and probably cause I m bad . Puck might just be better suited for offlane in the current meta . Maybe I m retarded though .
This is a realy good suggestion
Good idea to help puck 's farm but still he does nt scale that well into the late game as a semi - carry :
Yeah this is really nice , doesnt fix most of the problem lategame , but it is a creative buff !
Give him double dmg vs ulted targets
I think that Puck is definitely weak in the laning stage , but honestly she 's weak in every part of the game . Even if you snowball into mid game , which should theoretically be Puck 's strongest point , Puck is still incredibly weak in comparison to other mids which is why he 's no longer picked I believe .
There has been a classic case of power creep here in case of the mids in this game . As we know , most / if not all of the tempo controlling mids that we used to see more often like Magnus or Puck or no longer seen in the pro scene because they have no flash farm and that 's all that mid is these days .
Your mid is basically your pos 1 and your safelane carry has second priority when it comes to farm .
how is puck weak ?
He 's a very weak Hero at the moment and there are always better choices in any game .
Puck working as intended .
Whoops .
,
and u need to make the illusory orb a bit move faster . it 's like too ez for people to dodge that orb .
I know . I see that match . Just click bait . lol
nice idea
this doesnt really solve any issues tho . the cooldown is still higher than other nukes while doing less damage . mana isnt a big issue for puck unless youre just using too many
that ll fix him .
Please , this is reddit - you must meme correctly . Try :
nobody cares
Your salty tears are so delicious
yes mr 5 . 5 mmr


Why do people not build orchid on puck o . o that hero could function in like every way as qop does ( albeit worse attack animation and a little bit less dmg )
because puck needs the blink first no matter what , by which time its between 8 and 13 min . unless you really snowball from there , building an orchid is gonna take another 7 - 10 min , and at that point , you may want some other type of item , because the blink and the orchid overlap in their function to a large extent ( they help you to snowball ) it would probably work , but i can think of other items that puck likes more , and since the hero has a built in silence , it does nt seem like it adds a ton of value .
qop blink cooldown is low and spammable , orb high mana cost and long cooldown , you can only choose to get in or get out from fight , nobody prefer the latter .
puck need blink desperately in order to play her to full potential
I d rather save that gold to get either a Euls or Hex as Puck is all about them disables and escapes . Euls is the item for that .
It 's like when people only played carry slardar and realized he 's a utility hero .
I think orchid could work in a lot of situations , but the hero itself needs a buff . like 2 - 3 base str and + 5 agi gain would solve most of pucks problems imho
This is so you can spam - click the Orb while locked down without instantly jaunting for only 50 range .
The same could be said about the other button - replacing skills I mentioned . If it were a real problem , a 0 . 5 second hard cooldown between casting and jaunting could be implemented .
Yeah , and the same should be applied to those spells . Trying to get away as Phoenix can be very frustrating when you use Dive for 100 range .
Even better : being able to hit Q again to jaunt would be perfect . It 's like that in HoN and it feels so much smoother .
Mirana will never be more than a rare situational pick again , mark my words .
oh i remember when people said the same about sniper .
tagged
Dude , Techies has been in the meta . Everyone can be viable .
By rare I meant maybe 1 / 5 patches you will maybe ever see her a couple of times .
Nyx would counter the orb so hard , also EMP to an extent
In most cases you could Jaunt EMP , but Nyx would be a problem . It kinda forces mangos on Puck , which is nt the best item on him early on .

Who 's standing in for Alliance ?

oh shit , kebap if qojqva ?

coz he doenst give a fuck about reddit / viewers
And they actually won ! And it 's not like Venge was useless : yes , it had the 5th networth on the map , but Venge does nt need a lot of farm to have a lot of right - click damage .
I mean in all respects its not that bad . Good stun good minus armour , good position and catch along with a dps boost is pretty ok like a t2 / 3 carry .
It 's not bad . VP won a couple of games with carry Venge already . The question is : what 's the point in kicking Illidan and picking up a traditional 1 - position carry , if you still draft him the same semi - support heroes ?
lol , do you think carry players are swapped because they play different heroes ?
I do nt see how Silent can play heroes better than the way Illidan was able to .
New era !
I was wrong .
VP is trying so bad to show us that silent is a better carry than illidan :
no they re just showing that they re still VP even without Illidan
Why was illidan kicked ? Him and Silent sometimes feel like the same player just because of how consistent they both are .
When Illidan fucks up , it 's clowny . When Silent fucks up , it 's just sad .
we will know when silent chokes when it 's matter as usual
If they are nt picking proper heroes it does nt matter who plays them .

Torrent and Ghostship provide flying vision .
Reason : Since in the past 3 - 4 patches we have moved more and more towards more intensive vision control , I think this is one of those buffs that seems insignificant but improves the hero a great deal .
It would be a nice buff , but I think it 's going against what Icefrog has been doing lately .
Hmm I see what you mean , but did nt he nerf heroes because they were too strong ?
Hmm , the way I think of it , IceFrog feels that vision is too powerful as an ability in general . He completely gutted the whole " night vision " benefit some heroes had and gave that to NS , making it part of his kit .
Yea I still ca nt understand how does Mirana ( priestess of the , not have better night vision .
Because she is priestess of the , Not priestess of the ,
But all her skill icons are at night :
the moment you said " storm was buffed and was broken " the moment i realised im not posting here .
And removing the vision from ball lightening in 6 . 84 basically changed nothing as storms use remnants for vision rather ult and u can just drop a remnant while jumping .
So I dont see what your point is there
Slark vision nerf coming in next patch ?
doubt he needs a nerf : S
I really think the cast time on the boat with aghs should be reduced to about the same time as a euls . An extra half second or so reduction could be much better for him .
That is a very good point , the cast time is horrible .
I agree he is nt good at any role atm , he needs some direction .

Hmm can you explain what you mean by x mark being disjointed ?
Yea I m sure there would be some tweaking needed , the duration of vision could be changed and the AOE so there are many ways to try and balance it .
could disjoint *

Every hero in the game has a higher winrate on Radiant than Dire .
Most players have like a 60 - 70 % winrate on radiant in this patch .
When games are decided by matchmaking putting you on a random side that happens to lose 60 % of the time it makes it really hard to take this game seriously .
I do nt care about hero or item changes next patch please just buff Dire so it 's not garbage .
Not a massive change but it should be how it was .
Definitely think this is it . Would not be surprised at all if Radiant got both runes ( idk 10 % more than Dire ) and just this was enough to cause the massive difference in winrate . I also think jungling is easier for Radiant , but pulling is easier / more effective on Dire .
Is nt pulling much better on Radiant ? Offlane pulls , easy chain pulls for safelane , easier mid pull as well .
Yes it is . The jungle is mostly in favor of the Radiant side . What is not a huge problem ( for me ) as long as Dire keeps the other advantages it has .
But one of the access points to the river should be changed to favor dire a bit more , I think .
I bet Dire Ancients will now be highground out closer to the ramp by the rune
Nice , that way you can pull ancients !
Dire jungle is better for doom , sven , bs , and other melee junglers
specially for sf , some pro teams directly ban sf if they are dire , cause they do nt want to run it and dont want the enemy team to run it radiant side , it is much closer to leave lane , stack a camp and come back and to farm it as well for radiant
But this also allows the radiant offlaner to pull the camp .
Exactly ! Out off all the advantages radiant has , atleast this is a positive thing for dire . You are not nearly as dependant on sentry from start . In pubs .
Radiant hard stack also much much harder to invade than Dires
Also much more difficult to deward successfully given the huge Radiant easy - pull camp 's size .
do nt forget about mid camps are faster to farm / stack since they re close . specially the ancient 's camp . And the radiant tower gives some protection to mid neutral camps too
I did some research into 6 . 85 Runes about 3 weeks ago :
It 's a known fact that there 's huge differences in hero pick rates , win - rates , faction winrates , etc etc in the various skill levels . Even between the tier 1 and tier 2 teams there 's differences .
Game was better before this level 0 alchemist nonsense .
i feel that is a very interesting mechanic , im okay being tweaked but i wouldnt like for them to be removed , cause i think they are fun



A shift with magnitude 1 . 0 translates into a 0 . 29 % advantage . 2015 is actually the year that 's the most biased towards Dire ( on average ) This does nt mean that every team has a preference for , or better winrate on Dire - it means that Dire performs slightly better than Radiant on average if you normalize for skill level differences between teams .
For those interested , you could also read these , discussing faction advantages in professional Dota 2 . Obviously pubs enjoy a very different dynamic , but it 's good to do some research before presenting your personal anecdotes as facts about ,
What happens if you compare radiant 1st pick vs dire 1st pick ( and the same for 2nd pick I guess )




Beautiful beautiful data that supports my opinion .
This relates to current meta and draft patterns , not faction . And it has literally no impact on the average player 's games , because most are all pick and drafts are nt coordinated as much .
you rock .
( sound warning )

,
No source , you pulled that out your ass .
Again - no source . You re just making up numbers .
A better buff would be to the second pick , maybe having it so that the last pick ( choice 20 ) goes to them instead of back to the First Pick , so there 's a " no room to counter " advantage to Second Pick / Last Pick .
Currently the draft goes as follows
So , in addition to what you suggested , what I d also suggest is giving Team one , the first and the last pick of the picking phase and always the first ban of the banning phase . As in :
It has already been stated in one of the Radiant advantage posts that this advantage is due to how matchmaking works and not actually Radiant being better ( good players with massive streaks / smurfs play on radiant . dont remember source but check top players dotabuff , much more games on radiant )
That 's a really good and very important point :
why is Radiant T1 considered easy to take ?
It 's super super far from everything else , it has a lot of jungle access ( from above and below the tower for choke points . if you have a fast team the enemy ca nt really run away because of how far the t2 is , you can run them down .
how do they play radiant so much more often ?
That should pretty much explain it .
CDEC won 2nd place at TI by playing at Dire .
and EG won first place by playing Radiant 4Head
Actually if you paid attention you know EG picked Dire against CDEC because they knew they are more comfortable on dire . So EG was Dire .
1 : 0
Check mate , Dire bias
Lmao , I got REKT kid
Do nt forget the Dire safelane . It 's a bit easier to get ganked but the hard camp is very close to the lane allowing some heroes to really jump ahead .
[ deleted ]
CDEC picked Dire above picking first pick . Your theory does nt hold up .
I feel like the camera angle give Radiant more advantage in laning stage .
0
That said i think i could get use to it , and it might help with the balance a bit .
I m not saying it 's a good change , but if this were introduced per - side I think after a while when everyone was used to it , it d actually balance the sides a little
If it 's optional , I d be all for it .
[ deleted ]
No , but Valve / IceFrog can force changes on to the game that people may not necessarily like .
I m talking about putting the ability to rotate your camera based on side in the options menu rather than making it so all players have to use it .
I wish there was a custom game where player always plays from left bottom to right top .
source 2 episode 2 maybe
Sounds like a job for
Then the game must be nearly unplayable for Dire atleast a few months . The radiant winrate will skyrocket ( pro match too )
Would actually really like this as a setting . I do nt see it happening though .
Why not ?
upgrade cost : 322 $
allows you to chose what side of the map you want to be put on , of 10 players matched chose the same side , they are all placed in the low priority queue , with their aghanim 's upgrade deleted .
upgrade cost : 420 $
lasts for 3 games
There 's evidence to suggest this , in LoL 's all random all mid map that is perfectly symmetrical on both sides , the side on the bottom still has a small winrate advantage
Playing from top to bottom is so frustrating as opposed to from bottom to top .
Where or how did you even come up with this stat ? Even if it were true , it 's a good thing pubs and reddit do nt balance dota or else the game would be awful . Just look at pro matches where dire still has higher win rate .

My radiant win rate is 7 % higher than dire , but i am a scrub .
Get on my level

+ 25 % that 's actually impressive
Let 's not go League of Legends and balance the game for shit players .
and yet somehow i have a better winning percentage on dire .
Faction Matches Win Rate
same ,

Last Month .

i usually play support or offlane . so it 's not that . But one thing I got to say . Radiant offlane still better .
Dire team needs an aghs upgrade
6 . 86 agh scepter for dire heroes will make them able to go inside a courier
Add some cast points . They make everything better .
I love the designs of the radiant and the dire , different advantages allow teams play around them . In pubs they re harder to execute tho . There would nt be such an unique feeling if the sides were exactly the same . I m not the one to decide to buff dire , but the winrates really speak for themselves .
interesting post from a few days ago regarding the radiant / dire win rate stuff

I m doing my best to buck the trend , 70 % winrate on Dire and 45 % winrate on Radiant in 6 . 85b . I do nt like the colour green .

I have 58 % winrate on Dire , 52 % on Radiant
[ Stats from 6 . 85b / 4 - 4 . 5k ]
That never happened to me in any patch before , I m sad .
I do nt actually get those " Radiant vs Dire winrate " thing .
My stats : Dire , 63 . 30 % winrate , Radiant , 55 . 56 % winrate
IMO the dire jungle is ridiculously better than the radiant . But jungle heroes are nerfed hard in these last patches .
Icefrog , please if you re not going to buff dire , stop putting me on the dire team 75 % of games !
But then every single competitive team prefers Dire .
no , only most of the , ones do - the majority of , competitive teams overwhelmingly still prefer radiant .
No , you are stupid . Dire still has higher win rate in competitive . Dire still has major advantages .
The difference between Radiant and Dire is that Dires advantages are rather massive but they require teamwork to utilize , while Radiants just requires knowledge of their existence . Radiant has a higher win rate because the advantages are easier to use .
Dire is still the stronger side when it counts ( at pro level )
Given that almost all pro team have a huge preference for playing on Dire , i highly doubt it will be any buff to it .
Play a pre game to decide who gets radiant ?
To me Dire seems way stronger than Radiant and I have higher winrate on Dire in this patch . It might be that higher winrates on Radiant are due to biased matchmaking , not inherent differences between sides .
Thing is , they are closely balanced in competitive play so a nerf to radiant would make dire broken in pro games .

for a very long time ( like 2 years ) I have the feeling that the more tilted and willing to throw players are on the dire side .
Radiant offlane is probably 2 times better than the Dire offlane . There 's a huge difference in the Mid lane as well .
Being dire is easier to steal radiants jungle tho
I guess thats part of the " skill " though . Gotta be able to handle both .
Dire Aghs Upgrade - increase ancient 1000 hp and 20 armor , and an active skill to blow up everything around it 5000 pure damage .
I dont know whether what said by OP is true but if thats the case why not like someone else have mention just let the dire team have a higher average mmr ?
Dota is balanced around dota , in pro dota dire is much considerably stronger . It 's very unlikely they ll buff dire
Isnt Alliance winrate better on dire ?
You probably play a lot of party games .
I actually do nt .
Holy shit , I just checked my stats on Dotabuff , I have nearly 70 % winrate on Radiant and 43 % winrate on Dire this patch
I usually dc my first game of the day on the loading screen if i m dire , 10 minutes of worth might be worth it to be radiant .
We stop dodging players , and start dodging Dire instead . That 's how to climb MMR now a days
I personally think one huge Dire advantage / disadvantage is their Tier 1 Towers
I think one of the biggest problems with Radiant vs . Dire is that people do nt understand that you should pick / draft heroes based upon which side you are on .
The greatest example of this is Shadow Fiend mid on Radiant and Dire are very different experiences .
THIS !


That 's about all I can come up with in my head . I do nt think the map is too imbalanced , but for wards and movement alone , Radiant have a better advantage in my opinion .
Most of the things you point out are to counter - act the dire roshan advantage . IMO radiant has higher win rate in general because most sub 5k people are really bad at abusing rosh advantage .
Are you sure you ca nt do it on Dire ? Big camp is pretty close to the lane , you only need to make sure creeps do nt loose vision . I know for sure you can pull it with Pudge
I have 50 . 5 % win rate on Dire and 54 . 5 % on Radiant . Maybe , just maybe this is true .
Dire has that nice ward spot on Roshan 's left .
Guys can you explain me why the fuck i have more than double of the games on dire than radiant ?
Dont buff dire , nerf radiant . This power creep shit has to slow down , is getting out of control
an example of Dire buff that I would like is moving their safelane T1 closer to the top of the map ( so you can TP into the forest for example , like on Radiant )
Jungling with ench or enigma is easier on dire , it gives you easy opportunity to gank mid .
Icefrog please do nt listen to people who have 0 idea what they re talking about
Dire has higher winrate in high mmr and pro games , you just need to get better at taking roshan advantage .
someone with dotabuff + post a picture of this , filter by skill bracket first

I have 60 % radiant and 43 % dire winrate in solo queue for last 3 months . This is fucking retarded
I think the map is relatively balanced for the most part , but the radiant jungle feels a bit more scary to invade . The dire mid have more open sides and the position of the ramp makes it easy to get from the dire jungle to mid . Radiant mid can also farm camps faster . One big thing i feel makes radiant a bit better as well is the camera position in relation to the map and the radiant and dire side .
you can pull through twice on radiant and once on dire . Also radiant can use the large camp to pull their wave back at the top lane . Bottom lane , dire perspective , it 's not possible : T
61 % winrate on Radiant last month , 49 % on Dire
Inb4 roshan moved to inside the dire base .
4 . 6k , is your god now
Just to put in perspective how superior Radiant is over Dire let 's just look at the differences and how they benefit each side .
- Dire has a clear advantage over Roshan due to their mid and bottom T1 towers being much closer than Radiant 's . Dire is also able to get greater vision over Roshan and a much easier time smoking into Roshan . In the event of Radiant trying to force Roshan , the pit is right next to the Dire T1 bottom tower and Dire Ancients , allowing a very easy blink initiation from Dire .
- Radiant has superior rune access due to the runes basically spawning almost directly under their ramps , making it very difficult to contest the runes as Dire unless you have a clearly superior level 1 lineup or Radiant misplays heavily .
Nope it is nt . What Radiant has is 1 medium camp close to the mid lane . Which is incredibly hard to stack anyway .
You just need 1 tango or quelling blade and Dire trees become a nightmare . When was the last time you saw no one in the safelane have a tango OR a quelling blade ?
Agreed . This is IMO Radiants only big advantage . But since we already have oh so many advantages in Dire it 's not hard to see why captain favour that side or why Dires winrate is higher in competitive games .
The common Radiant rune ward does not show all of the Ancient area , which the Dire one does . And even if you decide to ward on the Dire side of the ramp you do nt get vision on the Secret Shop highground that most heroes use to defend Ancient stacks or to just , farm it .
Thank you for wasting my time .
It 's actually really easy to stack if you take 5 seconds to learn the timing and positioning . You must not play Radiant mid very much ?
I was just saying Radiant 's rune ward gives vision of the highground leading to the Ancients . If you want to contest the Ancients there 's a perfectly easy ubercliff behind the T1 tower that gives total vision of the Ancients and Secret Shop . The Radiant ubercliff only gives vision of the Secret Shop and the Rune , which is a pretty weak ward spot . To ward Radiant 's Ancient you have to go to their highground and potentially get ganked , which is about the same risk as warding Dire 's ubercliff except it gives less useful vision since Dire 's cliff also gives vision of the tower .
I guess you do nt play in 6k mmr avg games . Where supports know efficient movements and timings .
You mean the items that 99 . 99 % of the safelane heroes buy ?
Which once again means that it 's easier for surprise dives , closing the gap to catch and harder for the enemy heroes to react with counter ganks / tps etc
I do nt get which ward spots you re trying to talk about .
To ward Dires ancients / secret - shop - highground you have to walk all the way to their ancients , whereas on Radiants ancient you can just walk to it in 3 seconds from the rune or mid lane .
For all the people who think camera rotation is a good idea , have you guys ever thought how this would change the fog of war ?
Do you really think the thread asking to balance the game for pub players is going to have people discussing actual things instead of being retarded ?
Every single hero in the game has a higher winrate on Radiant including Ursa and Lycan but ok 4Head
If you wanna calculate winrates calculate the ones on the competitive scene , I highly doubt icefrog gives a fuck about your 1k mmr pubs you dumb fuck 4Head
its because matchmaking puts higher MMR players on radiant more often and parties on dire .
blame the shit matchmaking algorithm not the map design
icefraud we need you .




























So i noticed this command earlier and i m not sure how many people know about it .
dota_player_auto_repeat_right_mouse 1
Now delete this post so enemy team wont know about it
or your allies , because fuck those rune snatching bastards .
But it 's out of capitalist greed that they all go for the rune and only 1 person gets it because they chose to take it from others . If it was a communism - esque situation , it would probably be split , but since it ca nt , it would go to the member of the community that would most benefit the community as a whole , thus , the alchemist . So I think it 's capitalist greed that causes this behavior .
though a capitalist would let he get the runes and charge a aghanim in return . Also in a communist dota game , the aghanim would get 1 rune for every 3 all other players would , so they should have the same ( more or less ) gold , and not accumulate on the alch
Downvote it to hell
I cant do that alone i need your help !
Go Go Go !
I think he uses some software to click the mouse fast , no ?
No he does it with the above autoexec command
Just kidding he does it with his divine powers
yes , just look at how our master spam pings , its divine Kreygasm
It 's really good for blocking aswell boys
is there a way to bind this command to a key so we could toggle it on or off
sure bro
bind " f5 " toggle dota_player_auto_repeat_right_mouse "
So copy the whole line like it is in your comment ?
yes copy this :
bind " f5 " toggle dota_player_auto_repeat_right_mouse "
and then paste it into an autoexec . cfg file
thanks a bunch
Yep no more bounty hunter 's stealing my 0 min bottle as meepo
" even feed couriers better than anyone else "
I do this too . It 's fucking good . Although 90 % of the times I play support or offlane , in those cases I just let them steal courier .
does it work if i type it in console ?
It does but then you would have to type it in the console every time you turned on dota
No this command is saved .
I see . How do i know if a command saves or not ? Do most commands save ?
doesnt it remember my settings like the other settings such as net graph and what not
downvoted for invisibility ( sorry ) but thanks for the tip
do you by chance also know the config for pink outlines as opposed to red ? like on envy 's or universe 's stream ?
I have that on already , but I ve seen pink icons on the minimap and pink outlines on enemy heroes as well . oh well , no worries .
oh yea man just go here

this will generate commands to change to whatever color you want
Cheers mate . Good website . I did nt know .
That should make the enemy icons pink and friendly icons teal just like EE 's stream .
Another tip about this tip : It does nt affect chain commands ( shift ) you can queue command normally and it wo nt spam right click
This sounds like it will be removed from the commands for abuse .
It is obviously not how dota2 was intended and definitely not fair to people who do nt use this .
tbh its not that uncommon to just walk up to the enemy and spam click for the rune if neither of you can push the other one back
Did this yesterday against an alch . They had 4 players there total . I just walked in and took the rune and died .
Alch could nt figure out why I d feed first blood to a support when I stole his rune . Maybe he did nt know it was 500 gold ?
hehe yeah imo its worth feeding first blood to a big bunch if its preventing alch from getting the rune .
but if you give him the rune AND the first blood you dun fucked up
you are still disgusting for picking huskar
My Huskar play is weird . At one point I had a 70 % winrate on Radiant and 30 % winrate on Dire .
No way , this is almost certainly for disabled people who ca nt click . If it were removed many of the people you see playing with no arms and shit like that could nt play
No this command just makes the moving command same as in lol which is its intention and should not be removed .
It is fair . It has some important downsides . Check comments above .
any cons using that command ?
he said cons
Might just be my style of camera control .
I am the same which is why I turned it off .
I have the same problem . This is the reason why I always toggle it on when the game starts , but disable it afterwards .
Oh ! So true . This also happens often .
Yes , absolutely . One con :
This might be related to attack animations . I played an antimage game and did not have this issue . But it happens all the time with Earth Spirit .
Still , I ll give the command a try .
Some good advice would be :
Only use it if you play support or offlane . I play offlane 90 % of the time , so I do nt care much about last hits .
Thank for the reply .
I swear I used to be able to pick up the runes better in Source 1 , even when I had to scroll to zoom in , it seemed much easier in S1 than in S2 .
Oh man that sucks . Use it for blink dagger , which would be quite useful for escaping after phase shift / euls / wk ult / etc
If your mouse supports macros like mine does , then I would make a macro that clicks an obscure key , and bind what you want it to do to that obscure key .
Do nt think it does . I have that , pretty much everyone has .
Is there any reason to not toggle this on ?
love it . adding it !
Or , after a lot of people start using this method , you can download an auto clicker and just bind it to a key , so that u can toggle it on when the rune is about to spawn , or when the courier does nt listen to you .
Could you give me the full command that binds the delete key to toggle this and also gives an on / off response in student chat ? Thanks !
Sooo the real question is if 2 players are using this and sitting on top of another at rune spawn , which player is alchemist ?
Great , thanks op . Way to bring to light another cheat .
use a keyboard macro if you can it can be faster depending on your keyboard / software
this fucks up my last hitting xD but good for getting rune
This helped me a lot of times to make the enemy Alchemist a sad Alchemist .
FeelsGoodMan
Thanks this will help with feeding couriers
I thought my friend was a godlike meepo player until he told me it was all macros :
There is a massive difference between using macros and using something that is intended to be in the game client .
except there are ingame commands to do things like 1 button blink + poof combos .

good point




























Does anyone know how to contact or yell at these catalyst ppl ? Thanks .
It probably got sent to the guy who got 2 at once .
It has been sent , and I have the tracking number . did you not read my post ? It 's in my countrys customs as we speak .
pics or it didnt happened




























This is bullshit .
I also thought it could nt get full any more . I bought a lot of bullshit for the sake of collecting .
It 's pretty crappy that I have to spend money in order to give Valve even more money .
Valve is a pretty shitty company .
If there is still an inventory cap would nt that mean that he people that bought the extenders did nt waste their money and that they should then feel , cheated ?
I do nt get how this makes things worse .
I m having trouble understanding what you tried to say .
Are you saying that people who bough inventory expanders , feel cheated when it was assumed that everyone would have effectively infinite inventory size ?
In fact you posted this comment in that thread .
If the function of those items , gone . then what ?
Also what bait and switch are you talking about . As far as I know Valve themselves never said that Reborn got unlimited inventory size , it was an assumption made by the players .
They used to be 10 - 20 cents on the market after an event .

No this keeps Dota balanced
All Hail Gaben
All Hail the Overlord
is nt it time to do some spring cleaning ?
Thats what the item recycling was really made for - if you do nt want to be bothered to sell them on the market .
More importantly though , it 's not spring .
I m impressed that you use that many items . There are really none that are taking up space ?
if someone actually buys them for 100 bucks , i guess you wo nt mind . The actual downside is that if you want to put 100 + items it can be a little time consuming
Pls do nt buy my $ 100 BZZ Pugna sets , guys . I need them .
Honestly Valve should give free inventory expanders to people every $ 20 spent or so . I mean you earned it
This is fair .
Add the possible to rent out your own armory space . People can have part of my inventory for only one rare a month . D
How many items do you have anyway ?
Wow , now I really wish I had used more armory expanders in the past
Why do you keep duplicates , if you do nt mind me asking ?
Edit : These are the only duplicates I have
like in CS : GO unlike TF2 . oh wait .
I would really like this !
" receiving item drops "
hello sir it 's me your alt
do you trust your alt ?
how can you estimate how full your inventory is ?
When your armory starts getting full , on the top right corner a " Armory x % Full " box appears . First time I noticed it , it was about 90 % full .
Create a new account .
I mean ca nt you just , gift ?
Remember when we paid for armory extenders ? Yah , me neither !
Can someone tell me what happened to the armory expanding tools I used back in Source 1 ?
Valve stopped using them with the addition of Source 2 . Everyone assumed that they just made inventory space infinite , but I learned pretty quickly that it was nt .
Right now they only / still expand your available inventory space .
Then what happens if you have a full armory and trade for something ?
Did nt even know that they removed the armory expander . Now this is bullshit .
only 10 dollars now available on steam ~ valve
Lol , I thought you where talking about more item slots for your inventory ingame until i checked the link .




























Blitz as stand - in :
Plz do nt remind me , that pre TI4 drama
my little Fnatic heart is still not recover :
holy shit its confirmed
I knew all these " offlane only " streams were nt just for fun . Hope they do well !
Team veggie will show em
Zephyr 3 . 0 ? PogChamp
Would nt this have some kind of issue if he ever gets invited to the main event ? Or Winter not being invited to Frankfurt was just an isolated case ?
The only way this could possibly get better is if Slacks was a standin .
Slacks should be the coach .
We all know he gives the greatest advice
what is the opposite of a midas touch ? because slacks seems to have that .
Minus touch
hand covered in shit
DONT PICK DAZZLE
and pyrion flax as manager .
and Ritsu as twitter guy
And Richard Lewis as marketing guy
Richard Lewis as security obviously .
win 1 game as a standin and immediately makes a new team Kappa
He won playing with Alliance , this has to mean something , right guys ? Kappa
After Alliance 's last performances i would say you are on the right path .
Id love to see that vod . Anyone have it ?
Game 1 :
Game 2 :
He was stand - in for Alliance against NaVi in game 1 today . Starladder . Good luck .

Thank you !

Did nt he move to LoL ? Kappa
Even though he 's primarily a LoL player , I think Maelk brings a lot of good Elements to his new team Kappa
Not Maelk , REEK

,

So joindota disband ?
Tobi " One Man Band " Dota is still there Kappa
More like one man disband .
this is a joke , right ?
Its because Synd called his team " STEAK GAMING "
So they would be VG ?
Ever since he quit HoN , I m not sure how well he 's been doing .
An Australian player in a team not tier 9 ! TI6 here we come mate !
Implying this team is nt tier 9 4Head
First time HoN trash not consider " best player of the world "
Funny thing is Slickz probably was the best player ever to pay HoN . He carried his teams so hard on lan .
reddit said the same with at least 10 other players , i did nt play hon so idk
Whenever a guy leaves HoN , the second best guy becomes the " best " guy .
The difference is that this guy was like the most talented player after the Fnatic boys . After Fnatic left it became new " best players "
Yeah this guy sounds awful as a result
TI5 EG , there 's ppd and .
His comment was written before TI5 Kappa
Is Bkid still playing ? he was a monster back in HoN .
He played in the inhouse leagues for a little bit and last I checked was playing HotS because Chu got him into it .
Ye , forgot he was friends with Chu .
So he moved to EU ?
He 's moving to Germany soon , according to Synderen .
An Australian moving to Germany because of Dota ?
Literally Tobi .
navi is back kappa
alliance is back
Party like it 's 2013 .
I d Synd can beat Na VI we party like 2012
liquid is back , too PogChamp
The kappa should be in your second sentence .
4 professional Dota 2 players and SyndereN Kappa
4E + S
how the fuck do you have more upvotes than my hard written story
I clearly put more effort into my post bro
He said Kappa
Good enough for me
Because despite of all that effort , it was nt that funny / interesting . This was a simple and well executed joke .
Neither of them were funny . But reddit sure loves their low - quality memes .
:
,
Reaves is gone
Synderen is gone
rofl pretty sure he still will cast the majors and TI
i wish i could give you gold
Reliable or unreliable ?
Aui_2000 TI Aegis gold ?
Next lan they play at . So never , probably .
Lets hope they do nt play this much this yr , so Synd can finish with 101 % winrate this yr
Holy shit for a moment I thought this was slacks
With that out of the way ,
Congratulations .
good shit go sHit thats some goodshit rightthere rightthere if i do a so my self i say so thats what im talking about right there right there ( chorus : mMMMM O0OOOOOOooo Good shit

close enough
Instructions not clear , summoned nahaz .
WutFace
What kind of steak do you want to be in life ?
thats a team i could see mouz picking up , only to let it disband shortly after .
Steak gaming ? did i miss a joke somewhere ?
steak because it will be rare to win a game KAPPA
Well done
How the fuck did you miss all the Moon speech videos after frankfurt major ?

So glad they got Sealkid , I felt like him and Jonassomfan were really the underrated stars of NiP . GL Troels !
I m pretty sure most ppl know how good Jonas play ( ed ) Its just hard to get the attention without winning tournaments .
This leaves the question on where Jonas will end up though .
Blitz is a sub for Steak Gaming !
Finally slickz !
No more Synd casts . BibleThump
Until after Shanghai Major MingLee
Until after Shanghai Major qualifiers Kappa
It 's the appropriate time to remind everyone this is STILL a thing
S L I C K Z !
SyndereN is going to be that top 0 . 1 % Steak now
He had an eye on Era , it all makes sense now .
SyndereN 's new boy band kappa
Did nt know he relocated for Zephyr , but awesome ! He was sick in HoN
Looks like he will be moving to Germany . I m actually really excited for this lineup : D
Looks like there 's commitment in this team .
Well till March at least .
Maybe . Perhaps Slickz is confident enough that even if the team fails he will be good enough to find a new team easily . Maybe he 's so set on a career in pro gaming that he 's decided Australia just is nt the place to be .

,

Dreamhack Summer 2012 never forget .
Good game to re - re - re - kick off his gaming career by standing in for s4 just now . Undying Aghs OP pls nerf
i hope it 's atleast medium rare !
2 weeks and the team is done
He should be available to cast at any major lans still .
Give era and sealkid some respect and change title .
This is the beginning of a new Era .
Well looking forward to that lineup , looks good + synderen .
they are from around the world , atleast 2 / 5 will always have a high ping .
fogged ( usa )
Best of luck !
STEAK VS VEGGIE


,

Slickz ? Oh shit those are my favorite people . Best of luck to them and :
This is pretty good honestly , Slickz is fantastic .
With fogged its doomed from the start .
That is a team I can cheer for !
This lineup has potential but whether they ll live up to it is the 64 , 000 dollar question
Is this even real ?
I just hope he dont end like navi Kappa
Is Synd the captain ?
is this legit ?
Wait , this is not another post about the Alliance game ?
What if Synderen casts his own game ?
Good luck I ll cheer for you !
Is this legit ?
Well 4 eu + 1 na seems to be the most optimal strategy outside of EG for western teams .
I hope this does nt mean he will stream significantly less , although it probably will .
NotLikeThis
Every comment on this thread is a joke of some sort . I do nt really understand . Best of luck Synd ! Did a good job standing in as well .
Welcome to the Dota2 subreddit
why did he call me





























Lol
D E S I G N A T E D
hey that 's great news good luck in your games m8
I think its not like that .
Someone said that they just changed the way ping is calculated .
I might be wrong but i am sure that i have read it somewhere .
Every single time I see one of these posts I shake my head .
Does everyone think that Valve is a company that spans all across the globe ?
right ? Valve literally has less than 400 employees
I experience frequent fps drops and packet loss when playing in Dubai .
Dubai 's improved
What time do you queue ?




























The problem with medusa is that there 's no good early item to build on her . With introducing a relevant aghs , I could image mid Dusa 's going treads / Bottle / Wand / Aghs and actually being relevant .
Mask of madness is surprisingly good because Mana shield blocks the damage before the amp .
I ve never considered this before . Sounds interesting , especially if you like to go phase boots on her .
my go to build is phase , mom , yasha . u can get those by min 13 and then u start farming very fast .
Waga used to build both Dusa and TA like that . Both really benefit from MoM more so than many heroes .
Lets say she decides to go Aghs in late game , i doubt with these buffs anyone would be able to kill her . She can easily go 1v5 with this if she 's farmed up enough . What do you think ?
There are good early items on her , just do nt build linkens .
void can contribute with chrono , medusa can contribute with snake .
That 's why you need batrider
Batrider might get nerfed again .
A balance patch is nt a balance patch without a Batrider nerf
Pretty sad that you have to add " serious ) to the title . Just shows how awful this subreddit is .
It 's Reddit as a whole , man . Check out any front page post that should be marked serious but does nt . Shit posts are everywhere .
It 's been necessary ever since a certain aghs idea had people becoming an item
What might that be ?
lmao welcome to
The issue is it does nt make the target invulnerable as they still take ( bonus ) physical damage . Or are you suggesting it works differently if you use it on allies than enemies cuz that might just be too confusing
Haha , imagine Dusa with skadi , aghs , crits , lifesteal , and mjollnir . Every enemy is now slowed , takes crits , heals medusa , and massive lightning party .
[ deleted ]
Fairly sure that it can now , they changed it a couple of patches back .
Yes , that was in 6 . 81 , which came out late April 2014 .
Maelstrom ca nt proc if theres already a lightning in the air
I like this , although I have no idea if it would be OP or not worth the money at all
Bloodstone Medusa new meta
- Medusa pulls the target Petrified unit or allied unit to her location . Enemies struck by the gripped target will be silenced , and take damage if the gripped target is a Petrified unit .

Entire post is just for this joke . And is definitely worth it .
So basically , you want to fix ALL of the main downsides of Medusa for 4 . 2k gold , which takes Medusa 3 minutes to farm anyway ?
Pls add .
No , the aghanim upgrade adds only one of the four options .
Ahh , my bad . Reading is hard .
good on you for admitting it
How can medusa farm 1 . 3k gold per minute ?
It was an exaggeration , and once Medusa gets going , she basically gets 1k gold a minute from lanes + jungle + ancients .
Too weak .
I agree with all but not 4 , lategame medusa is crazily strong , so that 80 to 100 % really matters
EHP increase by 33 % vs magic dmg ( base resistance of 25 ) EHP increase by 60 % 300 % 10 - 50 armor )
if we assume a level 25 medusa with only threads , agha and skadi she will have
EHP vs phys
and this example is only with 3 of the 6 slots .
if there is an imba suggestion in the thread it is the 2nd one .
Not only that , but the Medusa build generally contains Rapier , which is not affected by Split Shot 's damage reduction .
That 's false .
2 ) mana shield blocks damage AFTER reductions ( currently before )
the only downside to it would be that MoM would become trash on her suddenly
So now MoM does nt affect mana damage on dusa in any way ? Wow TIL
yea , its why its a good farming item on her .
It depends on what the aghs does to said spell and if any other bonuses are included . Also how important the spell is to the hero .
I really do nt understand why it takes 3s to become stone . That 's really a lot ! She usually have to combo , or else her ult is pretty much " ok guys , lets all back away and wait for the ult to go off and rape her !
You could also consider the fact that you also cannot attack Medusa at all in that duration , so she has at least 6 seconds of being able to attack without being attacked .
4Head
3 ) Instead of doubling the duration of petrify , it should add an extra second to the duration of gaze , an extra second to the duration of petrify , and it should remove the magic damage immunity of petrified units .
I think an aghs for medusa should be constructed with the assumption that it will be a situational 6th slot item . As someone mentioned , medusa does nt have time to get an aghs early . Therefore , the upgrade should be able to benefit Medusa enough in the very late game so that it might be justified over other 6th slot items in unique situations .
How about throughout the cast of stone gaze , Medusa instantly turns enemy heroes to stone if they are facing her within a 45 - 90 angle in front of them , if she exits that angle they get released from her gaze until they look at her again . Makes her ult more reliable but still fair .
how about mystic snakes applies the stone debuff for 1 second for everyone who gets hit by it ?
There is no serious post , only various degrees of shitposting
i love how we have to title the post as serious now every time we have an aghs suggestion
Aghs upgrade for medusa should be ult cd reduction and mystic snake applies a stack of petrifying gaze ( 2 stacks required to petrify )
Medusa desperately needs these 6 items slots late game , just like AM and Ember , so an Aghs would be wasted if it is nt good .
Why not allow magic damage through her ult ? With another tweak ? EZ aghs option .
So if you mystic snake a petrified hero , it would split into 3 other snakes that would bounce as well ( dependent on the level of mystic snake , this effect would only happen once ) This would give more synergy between the spells since most people over look that mystic snake is pure damage if the enemy is petrified .
nah medusa 's agh should the following :
Split shot : each shot will shackle the target to an enemy unit or tree in a line directly behind it . If no unit or tree is present , the stun duration is reduced to 0 . 75 .
Mana Shield : Also give 100 % evasion and 50 % MS
You forgot the one debuff it applies to herself though :

I want to see this

would still loose to tusk / qop / gyro shit
thx for downvote so much you fucks for speaking the truth
Mystic snake now has an unlimited bounces like a Lich aghs ulti . Kappa
unlike lich ult the damages increased 35 % per bounce . Seems balanced to me .
I know , right ?
I guess her ulti scaling should be fixed first before considering aghs upgrade . even worse than fire remnant scaling .
For aghs upgrade , i think it would be good idea to somehow release a ( maybe weaker version ) of mystic snake to all opposing units who turned away after being affected by her ultimate .
Why ?
Aghanim 's improves the hero 's ultimate . Even on nightstalker and tinker , it is still very closely tied to their ultimate .

,
So are Ogre Magi , Tiny , Alchemist . Ca nt say aghs improve their ultimate specifically . Edit : Oh and Nyx too
Alchemist 's aghs is nt tied to his ultimate at all . Neither is Tiny , tbh . Ogre , maybe , since the additional spell uses Multicast too . Nyx does nt either , it adds an additional spell that has nothing to do with his ultimate :
Yeah , that 's a fair point .
Last I checked his ult directly influenced the benefits Aghanims gave him . I do nt think you are correct here .
Tiny 's ultimate affects the benefits ? Damn , I did nt know that . And meh , the rest is arguable , I guess .
Fair enough .
I ll agree that Nyx 's is much more arguable .
Make her ult global .
Medusa 's ikr needs a rework regardless of aghs . There is no reason to get a 2nd or 3rd point in it .
Incredibly overpowered . The idea is nice but the numbers are scary .
There are very , very few heroes with aghanim 's having more than one ability upgraded . Yours has 3 .
he says these are the options , meaning one of them should be the aghs . Also medusa is not on the strong side ATM , so a buff would nt be bad
The options . he meant that those are a few ideas , not all at once .
Change to int hero .
Non - player unit with Stone Gaze debuff ( doesnt need to turn into stone ) can be killed with one hit by medusa .
Reason ?
Main question here IS :
Haha okay




























Always thought he played other games while streaming , quite cool to hear him talk about games I enjoy as well , especially when I love Dota after a long and brutal MMA training session . His twitch handle for anyone interested .
is he better than Deadmau5 ?
How can you be worse than him ? P
Yeah . If Deadmau5 actually spent 1 / 10th of the time trying to learn the game , rather than bitching about the game , he might figure it out .
:
Hey I sub to both , and ,
Oh an finally , I just want to add that : low priority to Dota 2 , is what Reebok is to UFC
Nah , overall , I think LP is a good thing for dota . Reebok , though .
As a guy who dont understand the whole Reebok deal , can you please explain ?
Ah thank you ! Pretty insane to read . I had no idea .
Wow . This is fucked up . I had no idea , but i m not really into the MMA scene so im not suprised i missed it . But its really fucked up .

Damn . That is a lot of money lost .
And then this :
I could go on and on . In short : They re not very popular in the MMA community right now .
you are nt alone !
Probably about the same number of t1 dota players
Me and my cousin play dota and are huge MMA fans . So thats two , 10 more for a dozen !
Yea I m a fan of Ronda and I still am but she definitely did nt expect that out of Holly . Up till that fight Ronda always had her way with her opponents , how they react and how she handles the fight . Holly said nuts to all that , and just denied Ronda in the mental and physical fight game . Now I m also a fan of Holly .
They both did after Jones
You re kidding right ?
Yeah
I ve literally just started watching this show too : D
Aldo vs Conor soon < 3
Fuck em up Aldo Fuck em up !
Especially if he meet a peruvian or pinoy
Or a russian kid . Kappa
Is he trying out the game or does he already play it ?
would think he 's trying to pick it up / kinda into it , why else would he have mentioned it
One does not simply " try out " Dota .
Yes one does . They might open up the game , try the tutorial and guided bot matches , play for a half an hour without getting into it and then just quit .
Someone already made a thread this a month ago i think .
I remember a few weeks ago he was playing the guided bot matches . He 's actually put more time into the game and has learned more since then ?
Oh no shit that 's awesome , thanks .
MM seems like an all - around great dude .
I actually like Conor 's trashtalk . Its a persona he puts up to promote fights and you ca nt deny the fact that he is doing a pretty good job . If you watch some interviews with him it is clear that he is a humble and down to earth guy .
I ca nt wait .
What does rockhold have on weidman ? People have been underestimating weidman since he initially challenged for the title
Well , Aldo is coming back from injury . The odds on McGregor is pretty expected actually .
Aldo and Weidman . Would nt be surprised if McGregor won though .




























:

Would be nice to change hero builds outside of the match
Yes , that too . Generally , I panic and just make my own custom hero builds before the start of the game .
You can make your own on , but that 's still a annoying solution .
This is something , they really need to do ! Take my upvote , kind stranger
The store tab is also gone . I wanted to buy a chisel but realized there was no store .
It actually does , you re given the solution when you need it , an option to purchase .
Well the image is from source 1 , before the patch that has Glimmer , Mango , Lotus and etc .
6 . 84 was launched in Source 1 . I believe the Reborn beta was made public after 6 . 84 launched .
wow , I did not know that . That definitely helps ! Thanks
OP . Here is my suggestion .

Awesome ! Hope they add this , it really would help those new to the game .
for heroes it does show the skills , but you re right about the rest nonetheless
I have always wondered this too
or heropedia
That 's actually pretty relevant for newcomers , if I were a new player I d love to scroll through items while queueing up for a game
because valve do nt have item cosmetics to sell yet
but muh skillcap .

Like I said , I would nt want to open my browser after a game . Is nt it necessary or important that it was on the source 1 client but NOT reborn ?




























Here is my first reddit post about it .

Hoping to get some love this time around .




























Still waiting for Arteezy vs KuroKy
* To the left , to the left * plays
summit 4
Kuro will draft support QoP and forget to ban Huskar .
Support bat , Support QoP , Support Sven , Support Leshrac , Support Doom EleGiggle
or support doom , or support lesh
Like Fy , but without Fy 's general drafting skill .
It 's not just one match . They played like shit against both Alternate and CIS - Rejects . They get early leads and then just completely throw them away by overextending .
Secret also placed second in the Major , while Liquid did nt even qualify .
Same story for Secret though
You lose one series to OG and then try some new picks and lose to Vega and suddenly you re a bad team .
kappa
so we should make a conclusion that they are in a good form after those games or what ?
No - one 's saying they re a bad team .
I m not even that much of a Secret fan .
Maybe next time you should toss it up and let it fall on your head because I think we know who the real bitch is here .
no one thinks youre cool :
Once I said something bad about the team they like , they decided anything I said after that was wrong . So why should I care whether they think I m cool or not
go and watch the vega v liquid game that just happened and tell me fata does nt overextend often
Fata does nt overextend often .
Have they not played against eachother yet ?
nah
Did i miss something ? I know all the Kuroky vs Arteezy stuff but what happened between Kuroky and Puppey ?
kuro and puppey are great friends , since they were young
According to Arteezy even Puppey is nt in good terms with Kuroky any more , but because they did nt say anything we do nt know if Arteezy is right or left about that neither .
Its just that he doenst want to play with him anymore . I guess they are still friends outside the game
Puppey does not follow KuroKy on twitter after TI .
Is anyone casting this game ? Seems like Starladder is casting [ A ] vs VP .
Yeah where is game ? D :
It will be right now , after this mega creeps madness .
Puppey will crush this fool .
Kuro > Puppey

Secret was left , Kuroky is right
Puppey was right
Much wow many hype
Lmao if Secret loses




























working as intended
Big whoop , I never get low prio , so those people are nt gonna leave my games
Yeah , I was there a couple days ago and I can say it 's horrible , everyone just flames like hell for anything and feeds and rages .
But it can actually be funny at times .
Yeah I ve found a couple instances really funny . I ve played 1 complete game where no one left and it was the only one I ve won so far . The rest have been toxic haha . But it 's important to find things that make you laugh in there , otherwise you ll be mad at life forever
Yep , I won 3 in a row because sometimes you find people who really wanna get out of there and tryhard more than in ranked : D
It 's like that in US East too . They tend to be flamers who ca nt speak English . But low priority is awful . You do nt get out until you win 3 games . If someone leaves you might as well just leave since there 's no hope anymore at that point ( trust me , I ve tried staying . It gets bad real quick )
I ve won a 2v5 in low prio before . Anything is possible in low prio .
Was the other person a friend of yours ? Cause I could maybe see that working . but I guess it also depends on the heroes you have as well
Was nt me , I was playing Furion .
new disconnecting dota2 servers now even more salty .
Kappa
I fed low prio games in the previous system more than 200 games or some shit and now it is so ez to get out . I win within 30 min every game cuz everyone is so dogshit .
Really edgy man .
2 much edge for me

the idea and editing that the creep posted it in his facebook was mine failfish i did nt say that i owned the picture

It looks like OP likes recycling content and farming negative comment karma .
Enough of this photo already .
Im also a pro creep

Is this a repost guys ?
dude are you twelve




























Mighty Mouse is a really cool dude , hope he gets some viewers :
such an interesting person
Yea do nt think that 's the issue .
I doubt he really has much time to play . so it makes sense if he sucks .




























" When I thought of making the team , I decided I needed a strong captain . Someone who can real take hold and crush the opposition . That 's why I picked Korok . said Lewis .
Korok says joining the team was easy .
Pocket strat : Pick Bane . Use Fiend 's Grip .
all enemy players except enemy coach who can still use tweets - to - speech ingame and otherwise globally .
Blame Icefrog for removing Last Word 's disarm .
FTFY
,
RLewis uses Fiend 's Grip on LoDa !
It 's super effective !
RLewis has disconnected from the game .
This game is now safe to leave .
You could say they went right for the ,

I m already tired of him , though it seems other people are nt yet .
Thank you kind sir .

he was found guilty like , month or two ago

What the bot said is actually slightly wrong .
Source :
Pretty sure it was nt even his girlfriend , he got in a fight with someone else entirely ?
Meme explain bot is in the business of memes , not facts .
I died
Can this bot explain itself ?
I ve never seen you before .
What RL did is fucking retarded . but holy fuck how did he ended up as scapegoat , and Loda got basically no punishment for what he done is amazing actually .
Quite good ! You should ve left out that " We have a lot in common " part though , it would ve made it more ESEX . Do nt explain your references .
too soon
She does nt even try to Kill Bill in the first one though .
I mean they re not gonna call it " do nt kill Bill until the next movie "
Kill Bills mates
Kill the rest of Bills mates and Bill also
i like yours the most
You missed the the chance of talking about ixmike and mom jokes .
Two weeks left of this . eventually this sub 's gonna run out of shit , right ?
That 's some good shit right there

Not sure if shitpost . If so , it 's very subtle .
why is iwo on that list ? Did i missed something ?
I actually love the shitposts in the downtime between big tournaments . I have become the thing I hated .
This reads like an Onion post . I like it .
I think it could be more subtle .
1 . 2 . front page .
lol
3 . 9 / 5 . Not bad at all
What did the Pudge ever do to you , OP ? WHAT DID HE EVER DO TO YOU ?
Someone tell me what is 322 and who is solo
Player solo won $ 322 by intentionally throwing a match ( match fixing by betting ) 322 is now a permanent standin for any type of match throwing at all .

okay
322 is a reference of throwing the game regarding the Solo incident to bet against his own team and won $ 322
So , can we get a reddit flair with their logo ?
It is the cheap version
made my day .
" Discount " Since ESEX is free , do we get paid for reading your article then ?
A man can dream
please tag this as fluff
No beesa ?
I actually did nt realize that Solo was the 322 guy , not that it matters anymore .
Ritsu and Richard Lewis . Oh boy
To the front page !
haha i laughed when i found out who the captain was
Lmao so much shitposts
I d give it 8 . 32 / 10 , well played .
This is why I love this subreddit . I made a joke on the CSGO subreddit , and despite it being fairly well received it was deleted by a mod because it was a joke .
turns into the the Onion .
Is this suppose to be funny or something ?
i think the op mistook comedy flair for bug flair
There is nt even a single aghs idea .




























3 / 10
Incredibly standard
Do nt disagree , but at my MMR pulling this off feels pretty good .
Why was the shackle does not latch ?
Nice hero .
The glimpse animation looks incredibly similar to the mango animation .
Mango :
Its annoying to me when people know what a hero can do , and then " complain " when he does it .
Who 's complaining ? I m just happy I hit my timings .
If they were to have a decent disable you d die and lose aegis easily .
But out of that situation you did well yes
yea i was really hoping to see a static storm remnant dodge once i saw the glimpse come up .




























dong is full tilt trying to get that mmr achievement these past few days .
7k , still trying .
cartman literally bulldong .

Hes had a few rough days . His recent match list is full of red .
Literally one of the worst , I have ever seen .
I m pretty sure that was a joke .
That logic also means that its more likely for a smurf to be on the enemy team than on yours :
Unless you yourself smurf , which provides your team higher chance of a smurf every time because you have a guaranteed smurf every match .
reddit told me that only core players can be bad teammates , maybe we should look at this from the wisp 's point of view ,
Why would he even do that on a tower with 70 % hp ? Wow .
I hope he got LP after that match .
Keep spamming more random words you do nt understand
Go google SJW and then see that you are actually exactly what I said you are .
You would not be correcting people unless it was to make yourself feel better , were offended , or you just want to argue .
Pick one .
Nope . Do you really think I get offended by random internet people 's incorrect usage of grammar ? Please , you are not that important to me .
Nope again . I occasionally correct other people 's grammar if I feel like it . More often I will correct it only if I have something to add . Also I do nt do it for my own personal reputation . Why would I give a damn about reddit reputation ?
0 . 5 / 3 , that 's some great definition of me .
If you did nt find the response interesting , you would have had no need to reply . Here is the definition of the word .
verb : interest
Did nt know I could only respond to interesting things . Damn , you made me realize things about myself even I did nt know . Thanks , random internet stranger !
No , it could nt be just because I felt like it . Or that I was waiting for something . Nah , surely you interest me .
I did nt say you found me interesting ( 3 ) but rather my grammatical mistake .
Oh wait , you already said . it 's me . 3
[ deleted ]
Did you even watch the game ?
[ deleted ]
I ll take that as a " no "
IO 's what ?
I have no clue what you are asking , unless you really do nt know that wisp is IO .
Charlie 's pen - a pen that belongs to Charlie
Grammar Nazi is shorter you know .
Are you racist against grammar ?
If you consider bad grammar a race of grammar then yes . I do nt .
I see from your post history that you find it fun correcting people constantly . You should major in English and go teach it .
Just because I do nt suck at grammar does nt mean I should major in it . Grammar is not that difficult .
> 3
> D : Am I doing it right ?
Bulldong lost his shit again when Io saved the WK for the second time that game

Oddshot is so slow for me these days . Thank you bot
you know , everytime there is an oddshot vid posted , I click it and then go to the comments and see this bot 's post . It just is nt that useful for me .

Kinda reminded me of Jack Black
Wisp is the Hero with the most troll potential of any in the game . Tether , relocate , force staff to high ground and tp out .

By the time you do the damage has most likely already been done .

You make me sick sometimes reddit .
I mean , i kind of feel like it is a bit of bad luck for bulldog . He should be able to reach 7k eventually I feel . It seems like it is hard to gain control of the games in that bracket if you dont play mid well and often .
dank .
There is no such thing like luck . If you are better than everyone else , you will win , and gain mmr .
This is such a sad attempt at trolling
Yet , they fell for it so hard : D
boost solo mmr ?
They got proper rekt .
alliance lost donger tryhard
It really is annoying though when suddenly the whole enemy team is there to kill you - _ -
you should be banned i think




























This is exactly why i hate Alliance now , I used to be a proud [ A ] fangay during ti3 and ti4 , but i ca nt support them anymore .
I do nt know how many more kicks before they realise the real weakness in their roster is Loda .
Exactly , they should stick to one roster .
And this roster they had with mynuts was the one with most potential post TI3 .
Loda has a problem with awareness and sometimes makes bad split - second decisions .
Bulldog has great potential and he really should learn to play more heroes and maybe take a break from streaming . I can imagine that its a bit annoying for S4 to draft good heroes for Bulldog because the heroes he 's really good with that are viable in this meta are dark seer and doom and they get banned quite early .
Mynuts has been one of the best , most stable player Alliance ever had and they should have given him a chance .
This game is more about teamplay than individual plays , the purpose of this long roster lock is to force teams to focus more on improving their team synergy . In my opinion they should had stuck with Mynuts and waited for the next patch .
I agree with you . Alliance is a team that has 4 players that live in the past . They ca nt even play ember spirit and they are kinda stuck on their roles : s4 mid space creator , loda safe lane late game farmer , bulldog greedy offlaner .
Loda is by far their weakest link . He is currently XBOCT levels of bad when XBOCT didnt have the drive to play . He wo nt be kicked though because he is fucking the team manager .


,

Perhaps she should learn to update her shit . SeemsGood .
Reported . Kappa .
Do nt really see anything " wrong " in any of their decisions except for kicking niqua weeks before the ti5 qualifiers , but hey you gotta do what you have to do to win .
As good as Niqua was , Bulldog is a better player .

This is of course based on a whole lot of speculation .
I agree . Loda is the biggest problem imo .
This is like the second time MyNuts gets kicked or forced to leave Alliance .
edit : word
MyNuts have finally dropped .
From Alliance .
Synderen revealed his team one day too early , Nuts > Sealkid any day .
Wow , what a time to be kicked .
Now he only has 4 - 5 days before rosters lock to get a good team . Or he ll have to spend another season with a terrible team .
UncleNox IM UncleNox NOT UncleNox THE UncleNox PROBLEM UncleNox
Alliance currently looking to be the next Na Vi . In that they refuse to recognize that someone in their inner circle of friends is why they re not winning , not because of new blood .
what was wrong with mynuts ?
If you watched Alliance games - not much .
Alliance is basically the western Na Vi : kick the new blood , keep the old guard . Pretty stupid considering he was probably their most consistent player .
Nuts was left , syndereN was right
they kicked mynuts again !
Thanks Valve . Thanks community .
The game starts after Vega / Team Liquid game . The game will most likely be delayed .
You gotta destroy and rebuild man
I guess MyNuts was too salty for [ A ] s taste XD
Who will be the new support though , I wonder ? I have no clue .

This news . It gets me right in the feels . If I had to describe the emotion , its like a kick to Mynuts .




























Man SEA is just so cancerous . Icefrog needs to buff SEA server , literally unplayable .
there already is , its called SEA server .
Thai is in that too , most of them will only speak thai and play by themself .
I m not saying that because I live in Thailand , but I find most Thai players decent and less prone to raging .
Source : just a Chinese who happens to be on a vacation with family and decided to play dota on a shitty laptop
Just like white people .
No White people make fun of Asians because they are Asians . Thai / pinoy / chinese / jap / etc people make fun of you cause youre not Thai / pinoy / chinese / jap / etc
Maybe he meant that white people are racist towards other white people .
double edge racism
I think that 's because most of the kids in Thailand are playing HoN because they can communicate with the rest of the team in Thai . That 's the reason why we have more mature Dota player in general .
All the Thai players I meet are so chill . Have nt met a Thai rager yet .
Eh , from my experience Malaysians are okay because they usually speak English . Pinoys and Indonesians on the other hand , I m not so sure .
Then again , I m Malaysian , so I might be a bit biased .
Maybe because Indian servers are nt working ?
I am an Indian
Do nt forget peruvians
Yup , that 's SEA alright
Where 's dire 's 5th player
abandoned for sure . probably queuing on aus server right now
Wait you did nt see the riki
Because hes in pucks pocket , riki farmed aghs
Big fan , dude , you capture the essence of Dota so well in your art .
which one 's you

oh it even says " me "
so much to read lol my bad
It 's ok buddy , you re probably just dumb
where 's ward and courier ? oh wait .
Seems like you win all your games in SEA when you re always playing support .
Dire advantage is real
1 / 6 / 5 as Puck against Invoker ? I m speechless
CLQ followers ?
Chi long qua
Nice drawing ! Thanks for sharing !
I m not sure about what i m looking to , but you deserve an upvote .
Pretty much accurate .
Ok , WTF is an umlaut ?
That 's a dipthong .
A diphthong is two vowel sounds run together . The sound the umlaut represents may be a diphthong , but the sign itself is called an umlaut .
Holy shit he 's dead .
shh bby is ok
lmfao
It 's beautiful , just beautiful .
rofl that roshan

10 / 10 would deny aegis
2 / 10 no radiant t3 tower at mid
I guess at least t1 and t2 at mid lane got extra attention to detail
For a moment I thought it was SA .
dat axe is so cute : 3
I mean . I do nt want to flame but it seems you fit quite well there
I play on SEA servers as well . In almost every single game , I mute everyone immediately , making the experience a little less cancerous .
Clockwerk skipped leg day .
Looks like n . a . 2k - 3k games
You just need to flame more to win , that is how you will survive in SEA .
Is this a repost ? I m sure I ve seen this picture on the frontpage the last month .
its beautiful .
what the hell is bobo ? I had a fucking bobo army on my team last night and lost
I think I saw this somewhere before . Or something similar at least
Pretty much every game in SEA .
are you this is SEA and not EU ?
My guess is you have nt seen the true hell
So you are losing a 3v5 ( all I see is doom , invoker and . Undying ? and losing mid by picking a trash tier hero . Seems legit !




























The trick is to simply not use any orbs at all . Do nt activate any of them all game .
And do nt invoke for maximum efficiency
No , you only invoke . It is the only way .
You literally just run at the enemy heroes spamming your ult until you are out of mana . 11 / 9 it works everytime .
BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM
It will sure boost our gameplay
You know that invoker who levels 3 orbs before invoke lol .
I caught a tusk jungling because his ice shards are visible through the fog .
Yesterday I saw a Magnus ' Q inside the Roshan Pit , It was an Ability Bug or a Bug Draft , call it as you prefer
Well that actually makes a lot of sense . However , while I m not 100 % certain , I d say we did nt have any kind of vision those times I ve been surprised because I could see a spell in roshan .
And they dont know you can hit heroes when I lift with Rubick :
Dude under 2k they walk through a dark seer wall and ca nt distinguish which one is their hero
Funny story my friend played during the beta and clicked the courier on accident he stopped playing the game for a while because he thought his hero got turned into a donkey
True that
Right click buff to remove orb is the solution to go for IMO .
You mean we should play without orbs as long as we have illusions on the field ?
Yes
I understand everything
I was entering an underground station when I submitted the answer so yeah , it got posted twice for whatever reason .
now Manta on invoker will finally be legit
You mean we should play without orbs as long as we have illusions on the field ?
No
I am confused
You know they give a lot of regen / attack + movement speed / damage . right ?
How about a buff to him ? Hide the orbs to enemies .
best idea
imagine 3 invokers , switching orbs all 3 seconds , pretty strange : D
Wow . Not a bad idea .
What a cool idea valve do it now :
Hopefully Valve implements this soon .
Yeah , I ve seen 3 - 5 similar posts , I ll remind them it until its done .
Get Stats Instead Kappa
I love playing illusion mind games , and I love playing Invoker , and this has always made me sad .
This is due for a long time now .
it 's been ages . ca nt they fix this obvious thing ? played about 400 voker games already and each time i get an illusion rune i only use it for scouting and tanking creeps lmao . i ca nt even use it for bait .
He didnt have them in wc3 either
Does Invoker illusions even get the passive stats from the spells ( str / int / agi ) If not at least give him that
As an invoker player with over a thousand games . invoker sucks .
Illusions are nt useless on invoker however . Stacking , scouting and cold snap .
I posted this like last 2 - 3 weeks
name checks out !
That hero does NOT need a buff .
You forgot the Kappa
he beats basicly any hero in lane and has 100 dmg 2 minutes in ye does need a buff .
flair relevant
no Illusions does : D




























ARE YOU JOKING ME


lmfao
OH MY LORD THAT WAS NEXT LEVEL

Love the guy in the background 's reaction

Good bot
Is this a weird thing to say ? Is it just the false sounding excitement ? Everyone 's commenting it and they re all getting upvoted so I must be missing something .
P . S . I know that " are you kidding me " is more common but I thought both were acceptable
wat


,
youre gay
Joking aside , sick play .
Play aside , sick joke .
Are you joking me ?
Maut 's trying too hard to build the hype but I just do nt feel it .
I do nt even know what I m talking about .
It 's ok neither does 99 % of reddit but we say all the things anyway .
* FTFY
I think it 's just his voice that ca nt be as hyped as other caster .
Im not the only one who thought the commentary was really weak
edit : oh sure , downvote me for voicing my opinion , welcome to reddit

can someone explain this , to me ?

I do nt get what is so funny about it either , there has got to be more to it
is that beesa ? if thats beesa its hilarious that he said his own name and what he does in third person . my name is beesa , i play as the carry " but instead he just says " beesa , playing the carry " like he 's announcing himself
if not . i dunno
Maybe it has to do with the way he said it , seemed kind of rushed or awkward or whatever

ARE YOU JOKING ME ?
I m stealing that
THAT WAS SO * NET LEVEL
What relevance does this have to anything !
Fixed
I feel like people at least occasionally say " oh my lord "
I think fronz used to play with Merlini in pubs all the time . Other than that I know nothing about him .
Rime playing mid
I guess I wasnt the only one being disappointed , that this wasnt a Troll Warlord play .
Absolutely beautiful
this is actually so standard . smh
Yah but if he 's getting paid to play dota , the least he can do is be good enough to do that .
getting paid ?
Wait nvm , thought these were actual pros for a sec .
eh , average play . Obvious dark troll could net jugg , so it would be stupid to not dominate it in that exact moment and even juke your SB a little after to make them split up ! 5 / 10 .
You forgot about placing the sentry so the Troll could get the net off .
Wow . Someone report that Sven . Literally garbage tier player .
Autism detected
Go end yourself .
Autism detected . You are breaking a play down to " It 's only 3 keypresses " and ignoring the actual game situation around him . He was being chased by several people , one of which has a virtually guaranteed lockdown on him . He had no vision of the camp when he turned the corner , so having the presence of mind to dominate the creep , lay a sentry , then net all in a span of about 1 second is pretty insane .
Then again , you likely never lose games because you are constantly doing this stuff .
Literally all of dota is just pushing keys and clicking the mouse in the right place at the right time .
Fucking low skill bullshit game nothing but clicks .
The only thing I was pointing out was that you claimed " he had no vision " and that he " laid a sentry " neither of which were true .
feel like he could ve just bkb d bot and won the fight tho lol
9k redditor
4k is the new 2k
Net goes through BKB though .
I m talking about sven and the team fight bot
impressed : O
why is nobody pointing out that spirit breaker placed a sentry while escaping . This makes the play an even better one because of the coordination aspect .
was watching live and did call that it will be reddit front page right after it happened . now THAT is a sick play
T H A N K S P U R G E
Hmm not sure if it removes it , cause spin doesnt remove naga net so i assume it doesnt remove this either .
6 . 84
Oh wow , Ca nt believe I never noticed that in the patch notes :
Thanks !
It does nt . All nets are physical spells , spell immunity does nt do jack shit to such spells .
Magic immunity dispels Naga net now tho , dunno about troll .
[ deleted ]
[ deleted ]
Naga Siren
Immunity dispels , does nt prevent it .
That is absolutely insane .
dude what hero is your flair
outplayed .
Yea that 's Beesa for you
He " H . O . Ded " that creep beautifully :
DARK TROLL 322 - ed
Good
reminds me of
This is the part where you say " why did nt I think of that ? to yourself .
Bravo , well played ! Now back to my trench tier games .
Dark Troll more impactful than Warlord 6 . 85 , huh ?
But Kappa no Kappa that was actually an amazing play .
Dark Troll ? More like ,

I just want to hear tobi or ODpixel casting this , where 's the hype ?
Joking me Are you ? O
Eh , average play . Obvious SB would sentry , so it would be stupid not to go out of invis and even dominate a creep to stop him for you ! 5 / 10
omfg cant listen to this caster .
If he did nt netted the Jugg , he would still survive , because Jugg had nothing to stop him and his team was way back .
But style points , I guess .
If Jugg was nt netted , then he would have had vision on spirit breaker , so slardar would crush .
Put your shit together slark picker .
He used dominator on a neutral creep and used it . SO NEXT LEVEL
feel like he could ve just bkb d bot and won the fight tho lol
He probably did nt want to waste bkb before popping aegis .
































Elder Dragon Form : Now last 75 seconds instead of 60 .



First of all I think posts like this should be encouraged , I think it is good for the community to share their ideas .
Similar with dragon knight although dragon knight does quite like the stats .
I think most kunkka players ( like myself ) would prefer the 3 seconds to stay just to land it like normal . I was thinking maybe the rum had the opposite effect on enemies ( 50 % damage increase for 8 seconds and then they start to heal it back & also the slow )
Tidehunter one is nice , it gives him a reason to pick up an aghs and can be really useful if a team has lots of passives ( abaddon support & void carry )
Youre quite right with Dp and dk . Sorry but I dont really play Kunkka , but sometimes when I watch others play I feel 3 secs is quite unreliable . For Chaos Knight , I actually think its a little op . And youre right , 900 gem is much better .
1 second delayed Kunkka ulti also would be funny to see . At that point it should be called ghost bugatti or something .
ghost bugatti , really like it .
Mirana aghs would work really well in pubs with little detection , 0 . 25 fade time is quite huge ! If a hero has a greater than 0 . 25 second attack he ca nt hit you ! Although it is countered quite hard by a sentry !
I think 1 second is easier to land yes but 4200 to decrease it by 2 seconds does nt really help ( late game you want the rum mostly ) If you play kunkka enough you do nt really mind about the 3 second delay .
Also increases the duration , maybe give it something that effects them while invisible besides just true sight like increased vision . But I think 0 . 25 fade time is pretty damn good . Late game its usually just 1 person with detection , if you can pick him off first 0 . 25 fade time probably means you win the fight .
I thought of increasing vision too , but I think true sight is good enough .
0 . 25 fade time will be op af only if they dont have detection , so i think its quite ok ?
Well if it gave true sight , then they would be able to deward the sentry really easily .
This is nt a bad idea actually , if it lasted maybe 6 seconds , remember that gush also has a slow . I think just the debuff is fine , it does nt seem to make much sense that your allies get a buff even though they are , to ravage .
death prophet agh would be great because of the cd reduce . 45 sek is alot
You think quite a lot
assuming the aghs upgrade will stack with OC i think it might still be a viable option ,
Edit - yea i realize the 3rd part isnt rly related to the first 2 , FailFish
Yeah I think getting the two combined could be a good combination seeing as death prophet relies heavily upon her ult .
What if it Mirana 's aghs would add another skill . Half the duration , Twice the fade time but when not doing anything ca nt be detected by true sight and shared cooldown with original ult ?
This could be an interesting idea , maybe once they break the invisibility it is removed
As for the 4200 to 900 argument , aghs gives other benefits other than true sight and it is not drop upon death .
Change model to speedboat as well pls
Ghost speedboat
stun increased by 0 , 5s per boat
Maybe x - marks - the - spot is now an AOE ability that can be cast on multiple people , all returning them to the same spot .
What about as soon as ghost ship is cast whatever spot it has been casted a torrent is summoned . This will essentially auto stun then hit with ghost ship . May be a little op , but players with weaker skill shots will have an incentive to get aghs and better players wo nt need it .
I honestly think the speed is all it needs . Enough shit pierces magic immunity already , BKB does nt need more nerfs .
Almost removed this without realizing it was actually real discussion because I just finished removing 40 other aghs suggestions
Thanks ?
The ( Not shitpost ) tag saved him
It 's time to add shitpost flair
Seriously , is there any way of seeing them ?
tagged
but but but muh shitposts
look how awesome a moderator you are toot toot
necro ancient never forget
Can I throw in one of mine ? For Slardar : His ultimate now makes all attacks incapable of missing against the debuffed enemy , i . e . all kinds of evasion are disabled by Aghanim 's Amplify Damage .
I expect the spell will be nerfed in 6 . 86 in a minor way , so giving it an upgrade seems fair .
Quite a good idea . I wanted to do one for Slardar but he is quite strong now and doesnt really need buffs ( for now )
Amplify damage can now be casted on enemy building
With half the armour reduction it might be more balanced .
Break does not disable item passives like butterfly evasion .
Yeah i know , mainly for PA but to counter 1 butterfly is a 4 . 2k item worth it ? You d only consider it against at least 2 really as you d just buy an mkb . Its sort of like pheonix aghs , can be useful but not really for 99 % of games .
Think about it this way : a 4 . 2k item on Slardar would save everyone on his team the trouble of having to buy MKB ( 5 . 4k )
More stuff like Richard Lewis 's new pony , More Riki Aghanim upgrade , Korok kills Icefrog etc
At this rate the , mods will have to bring the shitpost tag for posts back except for real .
What do you guys think of an aghs for Anti - Mage that applies a debuff aura around him that increases the mana cost of enemy spells around him . Could make for some interesting , battle - oriented fighting style instead of the traditional split pushing that we usually see .
I think Aghanim upgrades that are only numbers tweaks are really really boring even if they may be viable . Alchemist Aghs upgrade has really changed part of the game and meta which is part of why it 's so amazing .
That said , this one is pretty sick :
This idea was stated already below , and its actually a really good idea .
that would be op as fuck if TA gets mobility of ember spirit .
could be balanced by mana cost . Besides Aghs TA wo nt deal much damage , and she is very slot limited .
well her farm speed would skyrocket with aghs and mana problems would be solved by placing trap in base
then it needs to be like ember spirit , she travels through all the traps to the last one . But this would look silly xD
That is a great idea though it does nt fit directly . Maybe like this ?

This is actually very nice , blink replacement that costs 2k more but gives much more stats , useful when you want to get tankier but do nt want to waste a slot . Also it would have better cd than blink dagger .
Elder dragon now removes active debuffs with exceptions .
I think he shud do that without Aghs . Nice idea tho
I good Agh upgrade for DK would be making the dragon form stronger and not refreshing it .
I feel the main problem for DK is he cant really fight without EDF on , and not EDF being too weak
that 's not how dota works . Dota buffs heroes strengths , not weaknesses .
I feel double EDF and extended time is already quite enough .
Sure , but having aghs be just a weaker refresher orb is not that interesting in my opinion . I did nt mean for them to be added to your suggestion but mixed and matched with other suggestions so that you have an item that buffs his strength ( EDF ) while keeping his weakness ( when not in EDF ) the same . Having to sacrifice gold and an item slot for something that does nt really do anything with aegis and buyback ( if you used EDF ) Most items are good on him regardless of form .
Not all aghs are core items that must be bought .
i am simple man , i see not shitpost i upvote
I am a simple man , when I see grammar mistakes , I help them by correcting it .
Slardar : Amplify damage is now applied on all crushed enemies . crush damage is dealt after debuff )
Pls no .
That 's fucking disgusting
Well tbh i like all the ideas u exposed in the topic :
Thanks :
Wow I m usually skeptical about Aghs posts but all of these are really nice . Well done man
Why thank you :
I really hate how this is required . What has this sub come to ?
Pre - patch shitpost season I guess
What is it with all the Aghanim 's scepter ideas recently , and the Item ideas .
Chaos Knight , Dragon Knight and Kunkka upgrades are weird . I really enjoy the rest though ! Really cool upgrades .
4 . 2k of gold for 15 second increased duration and an ability to refresh EDF cd for 200 mana ?
Not worth it .
Rather make in a way when DK is in dragon form , all of his ability got buffed ( might become a core on him )
Black Dragon Form
Magic immunity
extremely long bkb that does nt decay ? Dragon Knight is now the new Huskar . Rip Huskar no one will miss you though !
Well I think the idea of the refresh thing is that DK can now use aegis properly .
I d like to see people thinking a bit outside the box and applying aghs affects to other than ultimate abilities .
Riki and Io : very good ideas
That death prophet aghs is way too strong imo
Most of those I would never buy . Kunkka one is OP , mirana one seems strong @ lvl 3 and tide one would probably be the most balanced one .
As heroes , Kunkka and Mirana are kinda weak tbh .
what if torrent applied rum 's effect to allies in the area as a aghanim 's upgrade .
Ok so
Bounty Hunter : does nt justify spending 4200 gold . Add " does nt tell enemies that they are tracked " and we got a deal .
Dragon Knight : this is way more creative than the others and I think it 's fine . It 's not good when fights are short , but excellent if he needs to be the main siege tank .
Mirana : I like the idea of having an optional source of true sight if you need it and I ca nt imagine aghs being picked up otherwise so it 's well balanced . I think 0 . 25 fade time is way too low though , it makes it impossible to cast most targeted spells on them , including track and amplify damage .
Tidehunter : YES , we really need more sources of disarm , break and mute in the game so any addition like this is welcome .
The new DK / Alch strat , DK gets AC , Alch gets him an aghs gg literally unplayable
DP aghs should be like Luna aghs : she can cast the ult on an ally . Possibly also buffing the ally ( they get HP while the ult is going , then you get HP when the ult ends ?
Dont really think thats suitable tbh
Chaos knight aghs :
That chaos bolt / chaos rift combo is too op .
Chaos Knight , not too sure .
Dragon Knight , as a dragon knight player i think having to play around your ulti adds to the skill cap . It 's one of my favourite heroes and I ve been thinking about an aghs upgrade for him for a long while . Never came up with anything thats good enough in my opinion . However i do think making his EDF have dramatically more uptime is a mistake .
whenever I see a good agh 's thread I try to post my Vengeful Spirit idea :
Tbh , the main value of Nether swap is to swap the enemy 's important hero towards your team ; or to save your allies . And its great without Aghs . And support Venge will find it hard to farm a 4200 item , and is better of building stuff like force and glimmer .
Some aghs was never meant to be core
Many of the ones stated above are quite situational , maybe except Dp , Kunkka and Mirana
Tidehunter make ravage pure damage and pierce magic immunity .
PA Aghs :
2 ) Is ridiculously strong .
PA is ridiculously weak atm , she deserves some love .
Level 1 Coup de Grace is actually a fucking trash . It is weaker than level 1 Blade Dance
Imagine Tuskar 's Ultimate turning into passive , 15 % chance with 4 . 5x crit and free silver edge . Do nt forget that this applies to the dagger .
Many Aghs upgrades in the game are all kinda dull tbh
Crystal maiden upgraded ulti is already kinda strong if you asked me
i love how posts need to clarify they are not shitposts
Now is shitpost season , cant help it
Tide needs blink before Aghs , and most of the time heroes which you wanna break usually has a bkb
Break is not good against all heroes , so Tide maybe becomes a counter to heroes like huskar and bb ? Actually I did feel its a little op , but hey , snowball and scorched earth exists .
Jakiro ( rework )
Broodmother ' Im not sure if youre joking or not .
Jakiro 1 and 2 are decent , 3 maybe too strong .
IO
Tether has no cooldown . Tether now stuns units that cross it ( like it used to do before the nerf )
I didnt play dota back when tether could stun , but from comments about it I dont think its balanced .
In patch 6 . 79 tether was changed . Instead of stun it now slows move speed and attack speed .
I think the DP one is a little too insane . We d go all the way back to 6 . 82 when she was relevant .
Tide also looks overpowered , 7 seconds break is way too long .
Moonlight Shadow level 3 fade time is way too low .
I know . Thats why detection will be needed .

Manacost : 75
Cooldown : 10
I feel that 2 charges shockwave and gravity well isnt really useful tbh . By the time Mag gets his Aghs , Shock waves wont do much .
If you wanna make an Aghs for Magnus , upgrade rp , but i feel rp is already really strong and doesnt require buffs
Aghs on Magnus makes shockwave 360 , voker
May I add one as well ?
Invoker ahgs makes invoke 2 charges and the cooldown would be refresh rate of the charges .
Good ? Bad ?
Im not sure . The current Aghs is quite good , and Invoker is quite okay - ish in 6 . 85
Mirana 's is really weirdly balanced in that it does practically nothing for level 6 and 11 , and then is insanely overpowered for level 16 . Did you mean 1 . 25 delay maybe ? 0 . 25 is more than twice as fast as glimmer cape fade , and for a full 20 seconds it d be extremely powerful on certain heroes .
This would encourage her to build more right click damage and allow her to solo gank with really good arrows . Always kinda depressing when you catch a 5 second stun but do nt have the damage to punish )
0 . 25 sounds really really strong , but perhaps viable .
To make it clear why I think it 's really weirdly and poorly balanced I ll use percentages .
Level 1 - 2 . 5 fade to 2 . 3 fade - An 8 % improvement .
Level 2 - 2 fade to 1 . 8 fade - A 10 % improvement .
Level 3 - 1 . 5 fade to 0 . 25 fade - An 83 % improvement .
Did that on purpose , so that Mirana has to get 16 for it to be really strong .
you do realise kunkka boat always hits through magic immunity right ?
No it doesnt , check the wiki
I had a better one for Kunkka . Torrent is now also in the D slot , X marks the Spot applies a 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 seconds 30 % slow and impact radius is increased by 100 on all spells . Does nt always have to be the ult , you know .
Oh my god .
I completely forgot that Death Prophet was a hero .
I like the bounty hunter idea that 's good
Kunkka Ghost ship stun has such little impact compared to what the rest of the ability does and it 's not worth 4200 gold
Icefrog has been trying to make aghs upgrade make the hero fit into a different role or give them situational usefulness or a different playstyle and have significant impact , none of these are that
aghanim for dp makes here unkillable
Mirana , seems too OP . Choose 1 of the three you proposed , probably true sight , because it makes it situational .
Dragon Knight , I dunno about this . I ve always thought that all his abilities should now apply the current effect of elder dragon . Poison or frost slow for example . Fire breath thus acts like an AOE slow late game which helps deal with him getting kited , dragon blood will do a bit more damage and cancel blinks ( situationally applies if it 's only a lvl 1 stun , and you get interrupted )
DP , ignore the OP cd reduction , at most reduce cd by 15 - 25s . The instant health recovery is plenty good for it to be viable , because it means DP does nt have to build tanking up items like shivas and heart as desperately . Obviously so long as it 's blocked by AA 's ult .
Alternate aghs ideas :
brood : ulti : increses the bonus dmg and lifesteal of her summoned units by 10 % 15 % 20 %
clinkz : ulti , duration extended to 35 / 40 / 45 secs , health gain to 50 % 70 % 90 %
dk : ulti , reduces cooldown . the skill dragon breath deals 100 extra dmg and has 200 more range while in ulti form
drow ulti : attacks from drow cant miss the target ( like mkb ) enemies must be now in 300 range instead of 400 range to disable this bonus
ember spirit : ulti , max charges are now 4 . dmg to 150 / 200 / 250 . fire remnant speed is now 2 , 5 / 3 . 0 / 3 . 5 instead of 2 . 5 at all levels
io ulti : reduces cast delay to 2 . 0 / 1 . 5 / 1 . 0 secs and lowers cd to 80 / 65 / 50
lycan ult : lowers cooldown to 75 / 60 / 40 seconds
medusa ulti : when enemy heroes turned to storm , bonus magic dmg is increased by 10 / 20 / 30 %
i will post the remaining heroes which miss an agha upgrade later on .
Aghanim mirana making arrow invisible for the duration would be cool too
What if Mirana Aghs stopped wards from revealing heroes ? You need either dust or gem to see through it ?
Kunkka : You can now ride your boat into battle . You have to manually crash the boat though . If you re stunned while riding , the boat just gonna sit there . If you blink or forcestaff out while riding the boat instantly crash .
Dragon knight upgrade is imbalanced . Imagine having alchemist in the team . Even without alch , that upgrade sounds broken . Even with minimal farm the dragon form is so tough to beat .
Secondly , so when you say true sight from mirana ult . Ok imagine there is a ward , i see it in moonlight shadow , I attack it , i come out of moonlight and i ca nt see it anymore ? Or is it true sight for the whole 20 seconds duration ? because that too is broken . no gem needed to deward the enemy . just mirana ult and deward everything




























U should sponsor TEAM STEAK imo could turn out pretty great .
ayy
He was the owner of , EULCS team Elements , which was previously the League Alliance team .
EULCS
I get that much , but when was this " switch " to LoL so to speak .
I do nt think he plays LoL that much , just owns a team because EG wanted to have more than one team .
And he used to be on EG right ?
w8 did nt you sold Elements already
he sold the LCS spot but not the brand / org
ya they have a shitty CSGO team
Steak > Veggie
get your shit straight son

What they re probably doing ( and this would be way ahead of the curve ) is actually doing position by position analysis like they do in chess .
My point was that as far as I know , most of the positional analysis is statistical and macro . That is to say , it looks at large samples of games with similar gold leads or XP leads to draw reliable conclusions .
There 's a few things that will probably keep our analysis of Dota 2 really quite limited :
As it stands , the draft is the simplest part of the game to analyze ( it 's turn - based , and with a relatively small [ still massive ] set of game states compared to the actual game ) I ve been working pretty hard to make advancements in this field in the last few months when I have time .
Iirc , General mid , Yoky carry
I meant like if roster breaks up and illidan does nt find a team till then
Sad to see Yoky playing anything other than mid when it was that decision that broke Empire .
well he probably wanted to play mid or carry , better than offlane for sure .
Team Empire Rejects .
Is this the same rmN that was in Kaipi for half a second ?
, he is german from russia afaik

zxc offlane ? this guy plays like only mid ?
no . He was playing mostly carry , but now he cant play neither mid or carry in this team and sqreen put him on the offlane .
sQreen has to hold the record for the most teams in a given period . God damn .
04 / 12 / 2015 : Elements Pro Gaming renamed to sQreen squad
05 / 12 / 2015 : sQreen squad renamed to Walrus Punch !
As a 20 year old chess IM and a ~ 5 . 5k dota player , this is basically a dream . I know half of these guys in real life . wish I could be on the squad D :
Is this different from the Elements team that had a LoL squad with Maelk as owner ?
Yes
when has sqreen ever stayed in a team for more than a few days
Yoky trading position for being in normal team . His choice I guess .
Another sQreen squad , who would have expected ?
Is yoky playing offlane ?
Carry
still not mid 4Head
he said he d rather play support than offlane so it 's okay for him I guess .
meh , decent cores , underwhelming supports
yoky es best es




























channel your inner dong Mau5
Nature 's Prophet ? the perfect low priority hero

This is all you need to know .

Dank meme bro !




























Right now , you can edit " suggested items " in the shop in a DotA game , but you cannot specify the name of the build . In source 1 , you could see a list of all your builds and edit . Where is this in source 2 ?

So I made a build , how do I get it to show up in - game ? It still only shows " suggested items "
Does it not show up on the top of your hero builds section in game ?
Many times no it does not . The last time I played ranked I was super annoyed since none of my item builds showed up . I hate having to go digging through the full shop .
go to the guides tab , personal builds should be on top of the ones made by everyone else .
Source 3 will fix it .
fix one thing and broke twelve
Is nt this exactly what the Source 1 had ? I remember that was the one you used in the in - game browser
They replaced that with doing it in a game .
except it barely worked , at least for me , I had to do it in the page
yep , never saved properly our changes
personally I think it would be really great if you could submit builds with only items and not skills
You could do that previously , is it not possible anymore ?
You can still do it yes .
Its still in beta , valve has been working nonstop from major frankfurt and with the desert terrain map . Do nt feel so entitled .
Volvo I do nt ask for much . But this . Please .
Your flair makes me concerned about your playstyle
support LC jungle kappa
He is working hard on this one , but devs do nt give a shit

This post needs more upvote tbh .
the only upvote is need is valve 's .
Source 2 will fix it
the technology isnt there yet
So man we need more hats , game is great no hate now i masturbate
I miss that so much , but knowing valve i know we wont get this at all
You can manually edit them in itembuilds section of your steam / dota folder
please , tell me the folder / file to edit .
but lel doesnt have a replay function
top lel m8
Also , it seems that when I edit Item builds in a bot game , it does nt save . I do nt want to adjust my item builds during real games .
it 's coming back with source 3 kappa
This is like the most essential tool to the game . Furthermore , can we pre - equip the selected build to the hero in the game client ? So that we will not forget to equip the build and use the old build when ingame ! PLZ VOLVO !
This would be great as the game used to have this function ; However , this would require Valve employees do something with their day besides being paid to do absolutely nothing .
I mean , the Source 2 client has been out for months and particle effects are still fucking broken and show up in random places on the map . If Valve were interested in doing anything about the problems Dota 2 has , they would have started working on them by now .
I thought Source 1 's implementation of hero builds was kinda shitty . They have nt implemented the feature yet in Source 2 .
There is a simple fix to this bug , that requires no download at all :
They shat this feature half done , and never performed any maintenance . It is pathetic . it was released full of bugs and with each patch it gets worse .
k
Wait for the UI update , the complain .




























This probably has to do with the change many patches ago that made fissure stop creeps in front of it rather than making them try to walk around it , possibly applying some sort of invisible debuff that sets ms to 0 , with repel , they are magic immune and not affected by the debuff , or probably something else among those lines .
that buff is not even invisible you can click on it and see the fissure debuff
it 's rooted debuff iirc
This is correct . also known as ensnare ) That root effect does not pierce spell immunity .
so u cant fissure block ancients at all ? TIL . it still affects roshan so that 's pretty weird ( i understand he isnt magic immune but still seems weird )
so this interaction with repel is intended then ?
It does nt seem intended .
Yeah , but why do they ignore terrain .
When you cast repel on them , they become magic immune , removing the rooted debuff and preventing it from being applied again , allowing them to pass the fissure .
reminds me of the creep that did nt disable backdoor protection because it was repelled .
it also previously purged courier 's own magic immunity so you can cast normal spells on courier if you cast repel on them before
. Spell immune non - player units fully ignore Fissure .
actually repelled creeps do nt disable backdoor protection xD . this lost the old envy - BDN c9 a game too : O . so if anything u push a little slower ?
Literally unplayable
Obviously you fissure mid , repel the ranged creep to give an advantage when it 's killed first .
WHAT IS WRONG WITH REDDIT .
I DONT UNDERSTAND THIS SHIT AT ALL .
All magic immune creeps are not effected by fissure .
Fear not heresy
( sound warning )

,
idk about this but in nearly every case bear treated as hero not creep even if your statement is correct this is waaaay small to be considered buff
most useless bug in dota 2
Wait , you can repel enemy creeps ?
u can repel anything thats not magic immune iirc . even enemy creeps / heroes
afaik you can repel magic immune units as well but not sure only ally magic immune units or all magic immune units
Does the same applies for heroes ?
No
No , it doesnt . only creeps / neutrals
Thanks !
finally , good question
unplayable
Literally unplayable .
Really useful leveling up the W just to do nt let the enemy Earthshaker slow down the first wave of creep
game breaking

not if he 's a .

Stop . They re both fine
Pocket Riki has been activated in just 1 . gif in all time Reddit Dota shitposting .
Trying to take Nahaz 's job i see .
We do need a reddit Nahaz guy . Just like we have Empire twitter and Empire reddit guy .
is the reddit Nahaz guy .
Someone should make a reddit dota custom mode that implements all the stupid concepts that reddit thinks of
Is nt this pretty much what Icefrog does anyway ?
Are you telling me this guy is Icefrog ?
Holy shit you re right ! It never was Bruno , it is his unknown twin brother
Necrophos ult gives you an abandon and puts you in low priority ,
there is a custom game for reddit 's hero concepts actually , they ve only done serious ones so far though , I think
Riki needs aghs first smh
I needed to get the ability working first . I m not gonna buy an aghs every time just to test it lol
Make him play the animation on his R before jumping into their inventory , will look more natural .
I love you .
That sounds amazing .
Good on you for committing to finishing it though , hope if works out and gets upvoted

What a nice touch , I ll be waiting for it !
No . You wanna work for reddit ? You re gonna fucking do what reddit wants . Buy the aghs everytime or prepare to get downvoted .
Because Riki stabbed you .
Because someone with Riki in his inventory stabbed you *
With agh 's
The Radiant send their regards .
Not my hair
Not every time you test it . Just the time you record it .
I could put something together like that I guess
LMAO
Holy shit this is hilarious
Now just make it so it gives the hero with Riki Riki 's stats / backstab on top of theirs and I d love you forever
That is unless it drives you insane first
I m working on it . I just finished up the health / mana bonus on consumption . It lasts until riki respawns
Was nt it also supposed to provide invis aswell ?
Was nt overly difficult . I ll post the github when I m done I should be finished with it tonight
As a fellow developer who 's a little more realistic .

The amount of dad jokes on this thread NotLikeThis
Hey dad its me your son . can i get some pocket money
i thought you would be impressed son
Anyone have the original source ?

There is no source . I did nt record a video just made a gif
I just meant for Pocket riki
Oh god , the meme is evolving .
Its got backstab now too
you need help
I know .
Does it work based on Sven 's strength or agility ?
His strength . The ability says backstab is based off the host heroes primary attribute . So I made it do just that
wtf y so gud
Make ags an active that he uses
You are not getting a mod team for this , he means other kind of health
What format are your gifs that I cant open them on reddit sync ?
I m on sync at it works .
Android
nice smurf on reddit icefraud
Found Icefrog 's alt account !
You da real MVP
I hate myself for doing this .
Do nt hate your self . There nothing that we love better than a shitpost / meme that someone has spend more time than they should to make into reality .
Reddit loves you .
Well atleast someone got some enjoyment out of this lol
Fixed .
A meme immortal .
5 / 10 needs more bucket .

Icefrog , we need this now
I am starting to get cancer just looking at it I cant imagine what u are going through
You have no idea lol
How come the stats do nt change , and only hp / mana
because that 's how the original post described it , I d guess
Is that a riki in your pocket or are you just happy to see me ?
Nice try , Icefrog OSfrog
I ll get it all polished up fear not . Also I stole the icon from wc3 shh do nt tell Blizzard
Volvo , you see what kind of shit people get up to when you take too long to release a new patch ?
A mod deleted your ags courier i loved that idea :
I would but thats a ton of work and I have another project I m working on . I m just taking a hiatus from it waiting for the update
Good luck on your other project !
I thought if you get riki in your pocket , the carrier of pocket riki gets invisible .
Yeah , i havent gotten there yet
I think I missed the whole pocket Riki meme , can I get some context ?
It was an aghs upgrade as a joke giving riki a new skill to take an ally inventory slot and giving some bonuses
Edit : here is the link provided by

Thanks . It 's slowly killing me from the inside but atleast you got some enjoyment from it lol
I love you
Its . beautiful .
now just drop him in a random place at the map
Can you give some more detail as to how you did this please ?
I ll post the github and an explanation of what I dd when I m finished coding it
Thanks !
God saves us all .
the only thing riki is useful for
Buy the aghs everytime or prepare to get the ability working first .
some guy suggested an aghs scepter upgrade for riki where he could turn into an item for any teammate and the teammate can do wherever he wants with it , even sell and then riki dies and respawns , etc .
Haha ! Sounds fucking hilarious . Was nt a big fan of Riki anyways but I would love to use him as an item too .
The next step is to get this ingame . We are doing it Reddit
You can use spells while in riki 's invis so the ultimate pub nightmare would be Alch , Lesh + Riki .
Alch farms aghs for Riki and he gives Lesh perma invis while being able to use spells , have ,
How long it took to make these changes ? I want to make some changes to Necro , but I m worried about taking too long .
Sometimes , we do things because we simply must .
Do nt lie OP you know exactly why you re doing this . You want that sweet karma .
Best pre - patch shitpost ever .
It 's HERE !
wait I remember reading something about this , does anyone have a link to that thread ?

That 's the most broken thing I ve ever seen in my entire life
Since we already have pocket riki , can we create 3 more pocket heroes to buff a single hero in the team and solo the shit out of the other team .
Except then you only get two items . Boots of Travel and BKB . Probably not strong enough .
Agree COMPLETELY with this , and you have to spam your inbox with these haha RemindMe !
If enough people want info I might be able to use spells , have fun .
I would love to use spells , have fun .
your the hero we dont deserve
Now I ll have to
( _ )
( _ )
( _ )
I m on mobile and when i open the link my phone crashes . anyone care to tell me what the link 's about ?
This Kills the Riki .
You ca nt do this in KV dubstep What a nice touch , I ll be waiting for the continued growth of dota . even if it is pocket riki .
We really need those patch notes do nt we ?
Download the RES extension Holy shit you re right !
I ll post the github when I m finished coding it Thanks !




























There was no reason to toggle that moment anyway .
To be fair I think EE is really lagging there . All the armlet toggle seems delayed today .
I do nt think you can fuck those up even if you had a mediocre skill , unless ping issue .
against gyro with a constant stream of damage ?
You re probably right . I actually do nt blame anyone for one armlet toggle gone wrong .
His been using that build for some times on stream .
That is really odd because we lost both games with his old build compared to new one lol

he toggled armlet when he still had 400 hp hes just retarded
huskar flairs , please dont watch this its too painful
Now thats what I call previous level plays

,
2 - 14
Scientists baffled
Maybe it 's my game knowledge that 's lacking , but it seems like a bad idea to toggle while in melee range of a gyrocopter with rocket barrage running .
its closer to 54 % at level 2 with 1 hp
Did nt see the game . knew what I was about to see as soon as I clicked the link . Was not disappointed .
I love you Envy .
Thought it might be something like , Wasnt disappointed : D
Liquid is Back !
thats actually game losing
then he comes out with stuff u wouldnt even see in 2k pubs , oh god how cant u love this guy
BEST CARRY IN THE WORLD ! 4Head
Picking huskar first 2 is pretty bad .
The way EE played it made it look awful .
EE managed to break Pie 's BH record of straight wins
Misery helped out too , like a good position 5 should .




























really nice , upvoting . could have a lot of stuff , like microing , combos , etc .
i just want to get that " build guides " and add some itens when i m not currently playing a game .

That was impressive actually .
Someone is taking something too seriously , I think .
I m excited for it
Indeed




























title says everything
P . S : Staff cup I think
You mean the staff cup ? It 's a real thing except not casted by pros
edit : I cant say its not casted by pros anymore since quite a few of pro players took time away from pro gaming to do casting . ie . synderen , winter , blitz and merlini .
Ez game
Actually back in the day , Synderen casted some of those when he was still a pro player : I think ?
Staff cup is shit . It 's all fun until one or two teams " sign " a 7k mmr player to carry them because they " wrote " an " article " 3 years ago .
Joke is , now Blitz is one of the best casters in the casting scene , imo
Well Notail is still the best analyst ,
N0tail will always be the best analyst . He just needs to cast every game at the summit 4 he does nt play in .
At this rate , he can cast every game of the Summit 4 . They are playing like a tier 3 team .
hehe i know you said " imo " but holy shit man , ONE OF THE BEST CASTERS . im crying
The BTS team had Winter for example .
Winter did casting for BTS rather often .

: d
I think synderen should cast it , hes a pro player now !
but we want an expert analysis
Should nt expect that from pro players casting .
ctrl + c , ctrl + v cause I ca nt read shit and I do nt want to zoom in
The source button is a RES feature

He should play while casting
I think OP was referring to the good casters
again
I wanna see Merlini vs Maelk , some good old MYM bromance KappaPride
But AM counter Storm Spirit Kappa
One uses magic and the other hates it .
but uses it anyway .
But entertaining ? Sure !
A little banter is always welcome anyway , makes life more interesting .
Loda vs RLewis ? Kappa
top kek
Lewis playing Rubick , because force choke
I feel that matchup would be kinda boring ( techies vs Lich )
If this happens I ll literally buy a compendium of that tournament
so smart
It would be hilarious and entertaining .
They should play and cast their own game at the same time .
Western managers vs CIS managers casted by Notail + EE for English and XBOCT + Illidan ( for CIS .
or empire twitter guy vs VG twitter guy
I would love to watch a caster vs caster game during a major or TI , similar to the Allstars match and have pro players cast it .
This stuff sounds fun , but actually watching it is always underwhelming .
SingSing as a caster .
Yes . For the love of god yes . I would watch the hell out of this . SingSing as a casting and shitting on the talent sounds amazing .
Would be awkward tho since hes not that friendly with then
Dear lord , thank you for mentioning this - I ve never seen the SO SMART couch cast , but it sounds amazing . I ll have to check it out once I m off work ! D
This wont happen because the casters do not want to be criticized for their poor play and have it held against them .
Id watch just to see arteezy and EE cast a game
Is nt kotlguy like , 5k +
could be , he 's the only one one i was nt sure about but the way he described his pubs in recent cast made it seem like they were 3k , maybe its just the friends he plays with .
Yea kotlguy is 5k + Saw his stream once , believe he was like 5 . 2 or somewhere close to that .
isnt kotlguy around 5k + mmr ?
that 's 4k lower than reddit 's average .
Watching Staff Cup in the past has gotten old in like . less than half of a single game . If I wanted to see shitty Dota I d go play a solo queue game .
The Dota 2 community would totally do that , though
You know that there was a thing called the staff cup , right ?
and you know it will only serve as meme material for reddit trashtalk right ?
Yes , did I ever say that I did nt ?
You never mentioned ever having had sex
A load of them would clearly love it .
Where does Synd fit into this ? Pro or caster ?
Had you asked 2 days ago , caster . Now he has a team . pro .
Well he aint no expert , that 's for sure .
He 's both . So he ll have to play and cast his own game at the same time .
Which he 's done for how long on his own stream 4Head
It 's a bit different , because he will have to cast it like he would any other game , thus referring to himself in third person .
when does this staff cup take place ?
why not just have pros AND casters cast rlewis vs loda ?
People wanted country vs country tournament too . Look how that ended up . Nobody gives a shit

Yugoslavia still lives XD
too be fair , it wo nt go well when almost all the good players from each country already is on a team , they would nt have the time to play for their own team and national team
It 's going to be the same thing here , no caster is going to want to lose to the competition . Where is the money supposed to come from ?
because nobody knows these guys , but how about your favorite casters against each others , I will watch all of games : D
a ) It 's not much of a surprise nobody gives a shit when the only team who has their actual strongest roster is Ukraine .
b ) Yugoslavia ?
joindota has blitz !
who is technically an ex pro
Why does that even matter ? He is a caster now .
i think he is a sub for steak gaming now
his job is casting for joindota , i doubt they pay him to be a reserve without an organisation .
I wanna see Tobi furion .
I also love the idea of casting by pros , would add a lot of value .
I see . my bad
I wonder if the people working at valve are actually good playing the game
It would nt be fair because SyndereN would be casting and playing at the same time O . O
i think its a good idea
poor Tobi would get rekt , is nt Cap like 6k ?
Bulldong + Sing , casters Kreygasm
So you are looking for a 1v1 mid tournament between casters or more like a team between casting studios , like the Staff Cup ?
I have suggested this and will again here . But the summit should do this or something similar in place of the all star match
LD vs Tobi would be good . Merlini vs Synderen would be fun too .
2k vs 2k DansGame
Only good kappa studios should cast
But would it be as good as SUNSfan Sven vs Reaves Storm ?
Jew vs Nazi , the rematch . Fuck I would love to see this .
Tobi is Australian , mate .
LD = average ? Is nt he like 5k ? Dear lord are you a troll
The knowledge is there but they ca nt apply it correctly ?
Rofl what does that even mean .
Correct . You re entitled on having this opinion , for example < 4k is bad dota . For you even < 6k can be bad Dota , it 's absolutely fine . But " average " has its own meaning and 5k is nowhere near the average .
Shh he 's trying to sound like the 9k mmr redditor he is . Let him be
I . I do nt think you know what 'average ' means .
You are still a scrub compared to the average winners of TI .
That do nt make sense at all .
That 's not what an average is .
you know nothing john snow

50 % in English envySwag
SeemsGood
Hey do nt knock yourself . You re just leaving out numerous years of Russian experience .
it 's one of those really complicated stupid things in the English language
that 's not stupid at all , it makes sense to me even though i m not a native speaker .
It 's mostly comes down to how those two are pronounced together . Saying " an hour " comes much more smoothly , while " a hour " has that awkward pause in between as if something was stuck in your throat .
This is a common wrong concept taught in school . A or An is not based on the first letter of the word , but rather on the beginning sound of the word . Some consonant letters are read with vowel sounds ( ex : F , H , L , X ) while U has a consonant sound .
So the article to use is decided on how you read a word and not how you write it .
same thing as " an hour " because the h is silent
Usually does , it has many exceptions though . Maybe someone who is an English native can explain why ?
If someone showed me " ju : n v : st " I would never realize that that was supposed to be pronounced " university "
this cracks me up hahaha
this never gets old
If 50 is EE tier , ixmike must be like sub 25 .
Well he got in , did nt he ?
Seems high .
Where does 50 pass though ?
In India it does . India usually has 40 or 50 as the pass score .
Wow . TIL
If you saw the Majors feature on Envy , his parents did nt even speak English despite living in Canada . idk much about Envy 's past , but 50 is a pretty good score for him I guess .
I mean there are people living in non English - speaking countries with non English - speaking parents that are better at English .
There are many Chinese who failed in chinese language exam despite that 's the only language they knew .
Also no . Some people find it rather easy to learn languages .
Then what does he speak ? It 's barely English .
Japanese , obviously .
Envy ? ENGLISH ?
UofT ? EngSci ?
Cloud9 ? TI ?

I prefer this Envy
I really want to post a reply but I think necro posting is nt allowed ?
What . A . Find . How the hell do you guys find this shit ?
Google eternalenvy lol .
FTFY
You ve identified
1 Why ironic satire does nt work well on the internet
and
Jesus christ good comedy really is not for everyone is it ?
Google Poe 's law . TL
But they still have to shift through all the news , forum threads , reddit threads , bunch of other links to even find this . My guess is that OP knows him or some shit .
- site : reddit . com - news
ez
Or hang around PhysicsForum .
He had like , low 80 's . I think it was 82 .
+ 1 , this is a solid stalker post .
no personal life and google
He stated in his thoughts about whether he should join the scene that he was good on everything except English .
This is some next level stalking

That whole thread is gold
How do u pass with 50 in english ? Genuinely curious . In my school if you get below 60 thats fail and you have to go for summer school
In high school 50 is a pass in Canada .
You filthy casual fuck .

I can understand english , but how the fuck is your grade so low in math ?
In canada 50 is a pass
Still does nt make sense to post shit like this to this sub . It has nothing to do with Dota 2 , yes its a pro Dota 2 player , but the topic has NOTHING to do with Dota 2 , so I dont see why this is posted at all .
Is this supposed to make fun of Envy , or what ? I just dont see the point of this thread , especially since it has nothing to do with the game .
i guess ur new around here lol
at least there is nothing to be ashamed off here unlike ritsu haha
Yeah , but its stalking like ritsu tho
OP is 20 % Ritsu now I d say .
Lol this is just as sad
ya , you re a complete faggot . why is this thread even here . this has to be rule breaking some how .
what does this have to do with anything ?
no wonder he still mistakes your with you re , sometimes !
HOW and WHY
SeemsGood
so him repeating words is already a thing in 2008

Jacky LMAO
He was nt a pro gamer at the time .
So this does nt happen ? You should nt link your real life stuff with your internet stuff . Definitely would nt use your gamer username to sign up for school related stuff .
50 % in English .
Me too . I m typing this instead of working on my english final .
fuck essays , man : c
dude just read more and english will become so much easier
i ll do your english final for you if you want
my lord and savior
dunno why i got a good chuckle out of this but man i had me a good laugh

Wow , did you find the shortest path to that mark ?
Underrated comment , 1
Just stop .
Typical reddit stalking .
This is creepy and weird of you
This is creepy .
YES , my marks are wayyy higher than his .
NEW EE incoming boys .
how do people even find this shit ?
What does 50 mean for English in the US / Canada grading system ?
Did he get 50 % correct answers or ?
Edit : Is there something wrong with the forum ? Or why , after " I had a revelation ( lol . does he say pretty much the same thing all over again ?
Interesting . My HS had american education system and it was 60 % and above for passing .
He did end up going to the same program in the same university . EngSci at UofT ) so he did achieve his goal stated on the forum post :
I do nt know where he went honestly .
Yes , but that was nt it .
Was nt what exactly .
Him going to university was nt the happy ending to this particular story . Him actually doing what he wants to do ( esports ) is .
Ah , of course . I meant only in regards to him getting into his first choice .
Everyone 's referencing a GPA and we do nt have that here , so no , nothing like the English system .
He seems a pretty smart guy .

what he say
" what a forum "
nice doxxing bro
[ deleted ]




























nice ! you even ate the cheese before picking the aegis up . WP
edit : spelling
He could ve dropped his TP and used both cheese and aegis to their full extent but it was a great play anyway .
/ s
really good play though
Did you just blindly guess the timing ?
Yeah
Cool ! I also like DS esp coz of blink vaccum skills . Can you tell me which cliffs are still vaccum - able after the post ti3 patch ?
I believe the only cliffs that do nt work are the 4 very tall warding cliffs
definitely time for me to upgrade to a pc , usually about 25 fps but yeah it can be frustrating .
I do nt know how you can play with that . When you get onto 120 fps at 120 hz you ll wonder how you ever managed . You ll also fee like a god .
I m also running at 20 - 30 fps . Do nt worry once we get 60 fps we will be 5k mmr .
Are you console player by any chance ?

shots fired
144 fps master race !
I have a Macbook poo .
Late 2012 .
I get 120 in CSGO , but 45 in Dota ? PogChamp

It 's like both of you are me
TL : DR
wtf
how . i have a intel 520 and i get 40 fps
I have intel 520 and i get around 90 fps with minimum settings @ 1080p .
wtf am I doing wrong ?
edit : are you running windows 10 ?
I m still on Windows 8 . 1 . I have minimum settings except for textures at 80 % No special options on . Still looks just fine to me .
no change :
i used to have a fucking gaming computer too , this is hell
Shit man . with plays like that you obviously have some skill , things will only get better when you have a decent computer to back you up .
i play laptop with laptop screen , i dont have any issues . im sorry for your experience .
i think that also explains why everyone is stuck in the trench . literally pay to win
144 hz master race
There 's so much of a difference . At 120 fps / hz you get more visual feedback so you can make faster decisions . You get more of a feedback loop when you move your mouse so you can be precise . Definitely upgrade if you want to get better .
thx for the information =
or 144 fps at 144hz :
Dude , after 60 fps the difference between fps is nearly negligible
when you go from 60 to 144 it becomes an entirely different world
But the human eye can only see up to 40 fps / kappa
I m in the same boat ! Has reborn been better , or worse for you ? if you played 6 + months ago ) It has been worse for me
it was better at first . now it does poorly
Did you win the Game ?
nice fps
That was a great play man , I m really impressed .
I d like to think 10 fps is just when recording . i doubt anyone can play with 10 fps .
The most impressive feat of this video is that you can make that play with such a FPS . I would nt even able to last hit creeps with that FPS .
That 's probably why he 's playing DS .
It 's because there are no riki aghs references obviously .
Nothing is better than shitposts .
It 's the only reason I come here anymore .
You did nt snatch the Aegis if you get the last hit .
did you win ?
Alch had just spent buy back which is why they went rosh . we gg pushed straight after and won : D
Wow nice , that must feel awesome < 3
How many you kill with the wall ? Or did it just keep them there for awhile ?
Do nt think i killed any myself , but they were all on minimal health as the alch had radiance so his copies hurt his team a lot . Rest of team eventually came and wiped them :


haha nice never looked at that . Thanks for showing me that tab :
Kreygasm . That play was so dank , you just convinced me to learn DS and quit drinking .
AND quit drinking ? Holy shit that 's huge
Only dropping bottle for aegis
For those wanting to see the entire team fight ,

I ca nt edit videos at all so apologies for that .
Looks like game winning play , that PL was farmed as fuck and alch with no BB down for 2 min .
That reminds of this video .

Also , old ass dota .
How did you know exactly when rosh was going to die , you seemed to jump in right before : o ?
Game sense . Just playing . Even pros occasionally mistime it , but really it comes down to predicting it . Hence why it is nt easy .
Can I just take a moment and state how nice and constructive everyone has been in this topic . Holy crap , it can be done .
What 's up with those particles ? I thought there was a lich ulti in there with them for a second .
It 's bugged out in the replay :
Hey , you change your flair from CM to DS . Not cool bro . p . s . Nice play .
nigga , that was literally a flair - changing play
If I were to make plays like this , I d damn sure change my flair .
I got all a bit excited im sorry :
You are still melt though - pretty sad . how did the fight come out lately ? Where are you teammates ?
teammates arrived in time for aegis respawn , we wiped them and they had already spent buy back . Won the game 2 minutes later with a mid push .
Dat is clutch !
Very nice play !
I did yesterday , it went poorly BibleThump
I actively play with this guy and this makes me proud that I frequently are able to throw games like this just after he pulls off such a nice play haha .
:
Good ! you even ate the cheese before picking the aegis up . WP

Oh wow imagine if ES was alive too ! I imagine you wiped them anyway . What a play .
This is pretty amazing

Well played !
As if you did this with 10 fps , really impressive
WP bro
:
I wanted to see if the other 4 people stuck up there died . another gif maybe ?

Great play . FYI , for those too lazy to look up the Match ( ID : 1975429153 ) they wiped radiant 's whole team off this fight , pushed down mid and won
( ID :



,
I would nt even able to pop it on the action . wtf how . i have a Macbook poo .
Did you get a rampage since you had the wall up too ?
That play was so dank , you just blindly guess the timing ?
good job ! i m sure it wont be the last
did they died ?
sick play , is it just random luck that u blink just as Rosh dies ?
And then you immediately lost the game , right ?
Right

Here is your summary :



,
Dank seer at it again
I have never snatched an Aegis . You still have to right click it to pick it up , have nt you ? I only ask because I ve seen people snatching the Aegis and it looks like they just happen to walk over it when they use Timbersaw or Phoenix .
This is way better than all the performance you deserve while playing DOTA . no change : i used to have been better if you had the wall up too ?
Very nice , clip should last a bit longer though , I am always interested in comments that follow afterwards . P
limited to 15 seconds on gifs :
nicely done
( sound warning )

,
the title makes me cry
Why would you build a pipe vs a dazzle , wr , lancer , alch , bh lineup ?
radiance was hurting us a lot
did nt use guardian greaves before death , reported
i saved them for afterwards when the team fight continued .

Dark Seer flair checks out . WP
Hehe nice . nice .
FeelsBadMan
You forgot the fade to black + title text " And then I got away safely and we won the game "
Do nt say last ! If you are good enough to do it once ( and not choke ) you are good enough to do it again .
You re in a NoobFromUA video , mate
wow so I am . I did nt submit it to him though , strange !
Did you win ?
Why is it your last ever clutch play ?
Haha i m sure i ll manage another one some day but this one was turning a basically lost game to a win , do nt think anything will ever be on a level with it :




























If you have declined the matchmaking queue while spectating then do nt worry you can join it again . Just follow these steps :

Thanks god we have this reworked and intuitive client .

So , he 's a stranger .
How does the accept button remain after you ve already declined the match
Btw , is nt there any console command to easy this up ?
My brain hurts
someone post this with actual good formatting and decent English please .
Sorry man , I do nt know how to put each points in new line .

I thought that part was obvious .
I dont know if it works like this . I m testing it now
edit : no . It 's not .
wow i ca nt believe i l learned this today !
It 's ok , you ll get the hang of it .

Just say thanks . Do nt be an asshole
This is how we get shit
Everyone I talk to nowadays says English has been taught in schools for 50 years in like every modern country , is bad English really a valid excuse anymore , or it just people being lazy ?
keep in mind some countries do teach you english at school but do it so bad it doesnt even matter
There also are differences on a person to person level . Some understand english perfect while they are really bad at speaking / writing it , or the other way around .
( If there are spelling errors or wierd sentences , I will leave them , because mobile )
what if the match is found while im waiting to load in to the match i wanna spectate ?
i swear everytime i dont spectate a match i have to wait at least 5 minutes to find a match . but should i find something interesting to watch ( pros in pubs ) it gets found before i even loaded the game
Not too sure about reborn , but in old Dota 2 you could press the console button ( usually ` to back out of a loading screen
I ve tried this in Reborn . Did nt work .
I have nt tried in this situation maybe it works but if your system is really slow than it will take longer time to load and if that happens maybe accept button will not show off in main menu
yes it 's good to watch in client .
Can you search match while spectating a game ? I was going to make a post about it , but let me know if you can do it before posting it .
You can but u have to search for a game first while its searching you can go on dota tv watch an game or smth and it should pop up when a match is found .
No , You ca nt . You have first search game than you can spectate any game .
stop watching , start searching , start watching again

Consider RTZ 's profile
This meta - commentary is legendary .
It was the same in HoN . If brown picked carry , everybody started to flame : D
Always that darn fish .
Always that " brown be brown "
Dude getting blue or pink was worse ( same with being highest mmr now ) Everyone expecting me to carry their asses , when all I do is support . My core plays are several hundred mmr below my support plays .
Yep . It is .
In a way I guess this makes sense to counter Radiant having a higher win rate , as a 5 stack should be an advantage against solo players .
re : the MMR / color distribution thing IIRC it was that the people who had the longest queue times were put in blue / pink and the people who had the shortest queue times were brown / orange . in Arteezy 's games , he was always the longest queuer because he was way better than everyone else in the game so it took longer for him to find a match . the opposite happened at super low MMRs - the lowest MMR players would end up as blue / pink .
In the mid range , for 99 % of players , the colours meant nothing .
Do you have a source on that colors bit ? IIRC , HON 's way of sorting MMR by color was a huge talking point here on , before the release of ranked matchmaking so Valve took steps before the patch to ensure exactly that did nt happen .
Unless you re talking about unranked before that patch , in which case it could be true .
Sometimes it gets to te point that when i do eventually get radiant i forget that you can pull the offlane \ _ ( _ /
Say what ? You can pull the radiant offlane ?
As the dire you can also pull them up towards your tower without cutting a tree to pull the wave back too .
one of several reasons that the radiant offlane is considered the easiest of the two

Well he never plays alone but these numbers are ridiculous .
I have no friend . I have 1 . 2 times more radiant games . My radiant w / r is 1 . 2 times higher on radiant than on dire . Op is right , i am drunk
About the same for me :

I play almost exclusively solo as well , so I have no idea why I get dire so much .
My radiant w / r is 100 % higher on radiant than on dire 4Head
If I was on radiant as much as on dire I would be a 2x TI winner by now . Damn you volvo .
Does this mean the only reason RTZ is good is because the game cheats and gives him the easier side ?
I knew it !
While your use of statistics is misleading . you have a point . Yes , the chance of him having that exact number of radiant games is very small , but so is the chance of him having a 50 : 50 split . With over 5000 attempts the chance of any specific outcome is tiny .
The correct way is looking at the chance of having that many radiant games or higher , which requires the normal distribution .
Therefore a number as far out as rtz is still very unlikely , but not to the extent that you suggest .
if we use the normal distribution , the probability of getting that number of radiant games is still essentially 0 .
Actually if you want to be 100 % correct , the true way is to do a Chi - squared test to see if there is a statistical significance in the offset from 50 / 50 . That 's all you need .
For anyone who does not know what a chi - squared test is basically statistically tells you whether or not an outcome falls in line with probability given a distribution or whether there are unknown statistical factors / elements at play that influenced the outcome that has changed your outcome from being modeled by the original distribution you suggested .
You re much further from the truth than they are .
If you want to be really precise , the probabilities of being on radiant or dire are distributed according to the ,
For the values they give ( 5059 ) the probability of getting 2112 or less games as dire is 3 . 4 * 10 , So OP is only off by a factor of 3 .
edit : corrected a small error .
They took an approximation based on the normal distribution instead of binomial probabilities , which given the number of trials is perfectly valid under CLT . Qualitatively , they are right . When you do the full calculation , yes OP is only off by about an order of magnitude as you said .
To clarify ( for non stats people )
RTZ matchmaking numbers : 2112 games on dire and 2947 games on radiant making 5059 total .
Post OP calculated the probability of getting RTZ matchmaking numbers as , if the chance was 50 : 50 )
Thread OP correctly noted that Post OP only calculated the probability that RTZ would get , 2112 games on dire and 2947 games on radiant .
: Imagine you also played 5059 games , or did 5059 coin flips . What 's the probability that you ll get , 5 more heads than tails ? Very small . But if you work out the probability that you get , 5 more heads ( i . e . the chance you ll get 5 more heads than tails plus the chance you ll get 6 more heads than tails plus the chance of 7 more heads than tails . etc ) you ll find it 's quite large . Which is why you re not surprised if you end up with 5 more heads than tails .
In the same way , Post OP should have calculated the probability that RTZ got , games on dire , out of the total 5059 .
Additionally , Post OP did nt include the chance that RTZ had '2112 or less games on radiant ' We want to know how likely it is that RTZ got '2112 games or less on either side ' We do nt just want to know the chance of '2112 dire ' So Post OP should include the 'chance of 2112 games or less on radiant ' as well ( which results in double the answer )
What Thread OP did nt calculate was the chance of getting less than 2112 games on either side in 5059 games , so Thread Commenter said that Thread OP 's numbers were not useful . He did nt use 5059 games . He did nt work out the actual probability for 2112 .
Thread Commenter calculated the 'probability of getting less than 2112 games on dire ' as , As you can see , he also forgot to add on the 'probability of getting less than 2112 games on radiant '
" n is large " is usually taken to mean about 30 . My uni notes in fact say for this case it ll be valid to use it when it 's just 10 games ! n " being 5059 is without a doubt big enough to use a normal approximation by anyone 's standards . p " is also exactly 0 . 5 which means it 's the perfect candidate to do so . The error in approximation is almost zero .
Yup .
I know some of these words .
Nothing like a statistics discussion in , Makes me smile
No . He did nt give a precise answer , only that the probability in question is more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean , i . e . very very very unlikely .
The reply from , was not wrong ; OP did use an incorrect method , which could be seen as misleading , and hence miscalculated the probability . What OP calculated was the probability of getting , 2112 out of 5059 games as Dire . What you calculated was the probability of getting , 2112 out of 5059 games as Dire .
It so happens that the results are so small that OP 's and your calculations are very close and hence in hindsight OP could have been making an approximation .
how the fuck is this upvoted ?
nobody in their right mind uses binomial when it can be approximated by normal
Nobody in their right mind would use binomial when it , the situation at hand ?
n > 30 ( 1000 + in this case )
The chance of an exact 50 : 50 split over 5000 attempts must be way higher than 10 , though . More like one in 100 or something ?
Actually , its about ,

This is not true at all . You have just as much chance of getting 100 heads in a row as you do of getting a specific combination of 50 heads and 50 tails , but there are a lot of ways to get 50 and 50 . Like many , many , many orders of magnitude more ways . The odds of getting exactly 50 heads and exactly 50 tails is way , way , way higher than exactly 100 heads .
Consider the same problem with 5 coin flips . The only solution with 5 heads is :
But there are 5 solutions with 4 heads and 1 tails :
So the latter is 5 times as likely .
Edit : They do " obviously means they do nt technically prove anything , since everything is possible . It 's just , impossible .
Instead , the post is testing the hypothesis that being placed on Radiant or Dire is randomly assigned to players on a 50 / 50 probability . While you are correct that it is possible that any ONE person could be placed only ever on one side , the likelihood of that is so extremely small it is effectively 0 .
If you were to look at the graph the top poster of the link you use for an example , you see that MOST of the data of coin flips fall within 25 either side of 0 ( which is even flips ) Yes , there are cases where the disparity grows , because each outcome is just as likely but this is exactly what gives statistical analysis it 's power , which means it 's just as likely the disparity decreases .
TL
edit : not was important
The first part of you comment is correct .
But why on earth would the deviation from the expected 50 : 50 distribution increase with increasing n ? That makes no sense .
Now hang on , I m no STEM major but surely this is a bit skewed
It is nt
here 's what I can do .
My party queue games are normal skill , solo queue games are high \ very high ( 2 . 5k mmr party , 3 . 7k solo )
So I can find in dotabuff how many party queue games I had and how many solo queue games I had on each side .
So for the last 3 months
Side note : Also as party queue I mostly queue as 2 , pretty rare as 3 or 4 ( did nt queue as 5 in the selected period )
It is interesting that I got solo on Radiant more often , however for party I got practically the same amount of games on both sides . And the winrate on Dire solo is fucking severe .
sample size pretty small though , n is roughly 200
I ca nt do 1000 games in 3 months . And I do nt know if what I said about games skill levels is true for older than 3 months form now , and meta could change as well .
I just play a game on Dire , needless to say I lost , When i play on Radiant I can feel how i lose , but on dire i just lose while confused
Over a long number of games you should have close to 50 % on each side .
This would be a solution . I am actually fairly certain that there is no dire / radiant advantage , but rather matchmaking advantage .
All I can say is that whoever did matchmaking algorithms has done a piss poor job .
I also have far more games on Dire than on Radiant , and I have only ever party queued a few times .
Would be better to look at the statistics between pubs and ranked games as well . Maybe it 's different ?
I ca nt access my dotabuff from work , so I ll have to wait until I get home to look at the stats .
I made ,
I posted this on June 2014 :
If we compare now :
The difference :
from the OP . Now , his , vs , games in the past 12 months
Again , I do nt pretend to know what determines whether you re on radiant vs dire , but its clearly not swapping the two sides at random then or now . For example , consider this theory : Say the entire reason pubstars were largely on radiant was , the 5 stacks were on dire , and thus more solo queuers would be on radiant just as a consequence of that , and then remember that a while back valve made 5 man stacks stop matching against solo queuers in ranked all the time . Thats just one possibility
Are you sure this is only because of MM system sorting people and not Dotabuff counting various game modes and events in weird ways ? I always thought that was why the number was so off for me .
You can check only Ranked MM games :

They are putting solo players on radiant for some reason . I play either solo queue or with a buddy of mine that is at a much lower mmr than me . Looking back at my last 20 games or so , I m almost always on radiant when I m solo , and almost always on dire when I m playing with my friend . Maybe the highest mmr solo queue player is put on radiant , and the highest mmr player in a party is put on dire ?
I queue with a 5 stack on aus almost every time and we pretty much always get dire . The only time we get radiant is when we queue into another 5 stack lol
heh
Rtz is usually the highest mmr on his team ( at least when I watch his stream ) so the game gives him the better side so he has more chances to win ?

Analyzed a total of 100 matches . 47 wins ; 27 all pick , 50 ranked all pick , 9 single draft and 14 other . This bot attempts to analyze your last 100 games and averages out the stats .
,
So many secret matchmaking algorithms to keep us in our place just like the government does .
That 's all fine but it 's still a legitimate complaint in regards to professional play
iirc , Dire have a higher win rate in competitive this patch , tho . I ca nt find at Datdota where to find that information ( only by hero ) but even if there is an advantage , it might not be that big of a deal
People were quoting this in the other thread while completely missing the point of why Dire has a higher win rate in competitive .
That would mean that the teams who get to chose side prefer radiant for some reason .
What ? where is the stats that in pro matches Radiant win more ? Besides , that 's also connected to the drafting phase , so more variables are in action .
Same here . 300 more matches on Dire than Radiant

My party queue account : 57 % of games on Dire , 43 % of games on Radiant . Winrate : 47 % on Dire , 56 % on Radiant .
My solo queue account : 58 % of games on Radiant , 42 % on Dire . Winrate : 57 % Radiant , 48 % on Dire .
Sooo , your friends suck ? P
All I can say is that when I party up , the MMR difference in my stack is usually very large . Played quite a few games with the difference being the maximum allowed for a stack ( I think it 's 2000 ?
So where are all the people who play all those radiant games ? So far I ve only seen people who have played significantly more dire games than radiant games .
Maybe Icefrog is trying to even out for the radiance advantage by letting you play more dire games .
My Ranked games

Fair and balanced matchmaking my ass ( this account is for solo queue only , ALL those games are solo )
same here though even more skewed . My winrate on radiant is close to 60 % my winrate on dire is 48 % I got 300 games more on radiant then I have on dire , out of a total of 1400 games .

The math :
Expected MMR outcome per game : 25
Total MMR difference ( actual vs . expected ) 200 MMR
Fucking Volvo keeping me in 4k mmr
This actually makes sense . I remember once my girlfriend saw me watching sing 's stream and asked me why he was always Dire . I said I did nt knew , and after she mentioned it I noticed that as well , but dismissed as confirmation bias and never though about that again .
Now I think she * was probably onto something
So was your girlfriend a she or a he ?
post when ?
the sex change is just a shitty 6 years old keyboard
You should ve just linked , It simply states that the more trials you perform ( in our case matches ) the closer to the mean you get ( nearly the same number of dire and radiant matches ) After 5000 trials / matches , we should have close to 50 % split , but we have , Clearly not random .
I do nt have the time but it would be useful to see if his ratio of games have always been this biased . Go go reddit !
Edit : A cool little calculator by Wolfram Alpha to do the probability for you :
You dont math very good
Interesting post , weird how stacks always get Dire . Must be some reasoning behind that matchmaking idea .
nice , I hope valve will hear
i heard from couple of people who did 6k + stacks that higher mmr 5 stacks would get on dire more often than not . also experienced it myself .
The ending is the best part
So it 's like the new spirit breaker bash chance ?
Is this a repost ? Fairly sure I saw that exact post a few days back .
In fact , RTZ has more games on radiant than on dire , but his win rate on radiant is also higher than on dire .
I completely agree with your post except from the
Fuck Dire .
that is pretty weird . If this is true for all players , that it is not random , how would valve find out if the sides have balanced design ? I think your chance to win on either side shouldnt be affected in any way by which side you re on , this is pretty odd
By looking at pro games .
well you can always watch a individual game or multiple individual games and see how they pan out . It depends on what you want to base your balancing on . You can watch the stats and see that there are big differences with winrates on dire and radiant , even in pro games . There are a lot of factors in pro games , in all games actually , so it depends on how you want to balance . If you would want to check if the map is balanced on both sides in pubs , making it 100 % random whether the players are radiant and dire , then checking winrates on both sides , is the best way .
edit : there are other things you can do as well to make testing more controlled . But overall the map is pretty balanced in my opinion .
Thank you for the laugh on an otherwise shitty day
Before last patch , there was a thing called : 6700 average vs 6400 in solo queue . And 6700 was always on radiant side .
Well as far as I know in ranked if there is a party on one side there should also be a party on the other . Like 3 solo + 1 party will always go against another 3 solo + 1 party . So I do nt think that pubstacks are always dire .
since you re quoting stats of RTZ , how about the win rate for each team he played on ? total radiant wins / total radiant games . same for dire ) for me i also have more wins on radiant but that 's bc i like to play from bottom left to top , i think the orientation playing in dire is not as comfortable as playing in radiant .
tldr
and do you know that when you play dota 2 after a long time then valve puts you with team - mates with high levels for some games and then after some games you are placed with normal people
Looks good here .
not a big difference for me in number of games but it is in win ratio
But does nt matchmaking try to put parties against parties ? How does that work ?
And 6700 was always visible and it was that the odds of getting 100 heads in a party is put on dire ?
Well as far as I know in ranked if there is a small sample size in competitive this patch , tho .
Ooh god . People we saw that picture without reading the article or even understand it and will flame orange / blue for picking carry .
Give this man a raise - statistics and comedy in one post
8 / 8
You might be right but the data is flawed . That number is from " all lobbies " it includes even bot games . And from what I can see the filters in the site are broken so not sure you could get some proper data .
Of course this has never been proven , so It could be completely incorrect , but it does seem quite likely from all stats shown when this discussion comes up . Solo queuers end up with a more balanced radiant / dire ratio than those who consistently 5 stack .
But what causes the win rate advantage difference ?
I usually play as 5
The quality of writing in your post is legendary
Basically , distribution to one of the sides is nowhere near a coin toss for ranked games , but it looks pretty much like one in practice captain 's mode games .
Nice math pro , go back to school now
If anything , Dire is stronger right now . We saw this at TI5 ; yeah the Radiant mid is better , but the other Dire lanes are better . Dire can more easily transition into a 5 man deathball since they have that Aegis advantage , and their ancients are tougher to contest . Just because Radiant is overpowered in your passive pub games does not mean that it is the case in high level games . It is not . Icefrog please , do not change the balance of the factions due to reddit 's whining about 3k games . They do nt matter .
ppd told us that Radiant is better , we trust our lord , not you !
Perhaps they have hidden toxicity ratings for players , and the more toxic ones are on dire , while the less toxic ones are on radiant , making it a battle of good versus evil , and since radiant players are less toxic , they are less likely to throw / tilt , thus higher winrate . Not sure how stacks would work with this method of choosing sides and i doubt this is actually how it works , but it d be pretty cool if it was .
This is part of what I m trying to say every time this discussion comes up again . Players are nt distributed randomly . Valve said they had a single dev who did nothing but tweaking the matchmaking algorithm , so it 's pretty safe to say that nothing is random .
Sounds like they know there is a Radiant advantage in the lanes and they try to put the solo teams over there to give them an edge against the stack .
Mine 's pretty even .
Is this another reason why we need true solo q ?
Yeah , Baumi has a really high dire play rate compared to radiant , and btw great post
You just forgot to give any proof for your second claim

that video gave me cancer
your statistics tell something completely different than you say they are




























Anyone hearing these ? He apparently is saying some stuff about the new patch .
New camps

Finally .
True enough , and to an extent I do nt think you can ever accurately predict what a hero will do to the scene when it hits CM .
Still , in his current state , I do nt believe Oracle will be too insane . I could be wrong and he could be the next big cancer though .
Ive picked him a lot . Dont underestimate the cd on flames .
It 's low !
The best part is he has a high nuke damage combo + ability to help team take rosh easier . I feel like hes going to be one of those supports that you pick every game because he was just that good ( like TI3 wisp ) I think he will get nerfed , probably cast range nerfs / mana cost .
I think the biggest thing is he does nt have any AoE abilities ( do nt count the purge , the AoE is what , 150 ? He 's also pretty well shut down by BKBs except for his ultimate . I think he ll be fine .
Hehe . O -

oracle is a dumpster

to compare , earth spirit is 57 % in > 5k mmr
icefrog ruined his ult
icefrog ruined his disarm
icefrog ruined the hero
Eh , pubs ( even 5k pubs ) really are nt a good example of how a hero will perform in competitive games , especially a more " complicated " hero like Oracle .
I mean , Io is right above Oracle in terms of total winrate , and god knows he 's not weak .
An an Earth Spirit player i say thank god . I hate being judged for picking a hero I love to play !
Once he is balanced I will start spamming him again
I fucking hope so . They might not even many nerf before .
I think I might have an idea about a tiny piece of the map changes .
On radiant the ramp by the medium camp might be changed to be face slightly differently . I played a single game with this change . Once the game was finished dota needed an instant update and the ramp was back to normal .
I looks like the old normal way in the replay btw .
Edit
It could simply be a mistake or a change they tested and forgot to remove . with a keybind , no less ! Not saying this wo nt be a change with the next update , just that it could very well be an unintended change too .
What effect would this change have ?
harder ? I always have trouble with that camp .
Its cause I have to stack at 55 instead of at 53 .
Do nt hit it at 52 , hit it closer to 54 - 55
It 's a lot easier if you drag it up the hill to the right . But then you have to walk all the way over there and ca nt just go back into lane when you pull the creeps out . This change would not make the camp harder to stack , as the option to pull east instead of north still exists , but it would make it harder to stack by pulling to the north .
It would still be efficient every two minutes , as you could pull the camp and head to the bottom rune .
However unless you had a lot of MS already in the laning phase or had a support there to secure the rune , you would nt be there exactly on time , making it possible for an enemy hero to snatch the rune and waste half a minute of your time .
It depends on how good the enemy mid is . If they are smart and / or have ward vision of what you are doing , they might nuke the wave and push the creeps under your tower , making you miss out on creep exp and damaging the mid tower too .
Alright , thanks for explaining
Pulling straight out to lane is 0 : 55 . 5 for the first stack and 0 : 55 for the second stack on that camp . You have to be almost perfect with the timing in order to get it . Pulling it out to the side gives a little bit of lee .
It d also be a slight nerf to SF , which is arguably warranted .
FTFY
What spirit ?
that 's a stretch
I would think it is expired by now but .

you could have gotten so much karma m8



you should have gone with a different title .
Oh wow that 's amazing .
I reckon it could be to do with making the spawn box for the camp slightly larger to the north ( and perhaps maybe smaller towards the ramp ? so that it is less efficient ( and takes a bit more time ) for radiant mid heroes to stack the camp - thus helping to balance radiant vs dire perhaps ?
1 - 20 on radiant , seems like a good nerf to me Kappa
that change does nothing so it was probably a cosmetic change for reborn they did nt like
that 's ok bud we all have bad games . make sure to learn from your mistakes
Match ID , or when did this accurately happen ? It 's possible to determine under what patch was this played on and someone may still have that build stored . There could ve been other small changes too ?
It was like 2 months ago

Here is your summary :

Did he say what his source was or was he guessing ?
Pros get info on patch changes to give feedback to Icefrog .
source ?

cool thanks
well i dont remember the exact game and all , but i do remember what he said ( kind of ) storm 100 mana remnant all levels , nerf to vision , nerf to ult . lesh nerf to base dmg , cast range and dmg of lightning storms . that 's about it . im sure we could dig up the cast if we looked hard enough
Oh snap !
Well he coached top tier teams a couple times , I would nt be surprised if his opinion on the game was valued by Valve .
Well , he was a coach and he probably is one of the best colour casters there is in terms of game knowledge up there with Merlini and Synderen .
If it 's the stream I watched , Pyrion was saying he used to be given looks at patch notes ahead of time and he never gave good advice thus he stopped getting the patch notes .
Exactly . The way he said it was pretty fun : D
Pyrion exactly looks like the kind of person I d look to for a genuine , honest ( professional ) opinion .
Wow , what a surprise . s
what ? but he is the casual perspective , he represents the perspective of all of us under 4k , like in ti
Here if you want to listen Pyrion talking about patch
Is the whole cast any good ? Worth listening to ?
Either way , 2 weeks and all that and everybody just wants the new patch already . No harm in talking about it .
It 's not just likely , they are given insider information . IceFrog has a group of beta testers that allow him to bounce ideas off of . I do nt know if Clairvoyance is among them , but there definitely are groups of players out there who do get insider info .
I remember watching an interview with Artstyle where he told about Troll and Sniper nerfs before 6 . 84

Way better than removing Radiant 's .
Thats a big buff to Doom , wont happen
Finally someone else caught on to how this could help doom in a big way . I am not complaining either way but this would be huge to doom and a few select other heroes .
i do nt know if you would give up armor or damage creep .
I mean , we already have a magic resist aura on Pipe , and it is hardly bought , even on games where it is good on paper .
A creep that can be picked up at minute 0 when most damage is magical would be huge
Someone said have it as an aura that stacks . So like 5 %
And just as big a buff to Chen and Enchantress . Most damage early game is magic . It would buff their pushing power immensely by making creeps more tanky vs waveclear spells
I m down
yea just make offlane the second safelane
oh wait you already did that a while ago huh
I hope it 's true . I love how icefrog is nt afraid of major changes . Guys from sc2 just caught on

New champs NotLikeThis
He talked about two new camps and a pull for dire offlane .
2 new camps ? As in 2 new neutral spawns on the map or 2 new sets of neutral that can spawn ?
Probably 2 new camp locations on the map .
The other would be close to the Dire mid lane . This would give Dire a mid lane pull camp so now there will be no more inherent Radiant mid advantage .
This also has a third effect as a jungle buff . People complaining about jungle farming being nerfed too hard now have an extra camp to farm from .
I do nt know he did nt specify .
Most likely the former
If they get a rework yes . As they were in DotA no .
Indeed a Clairvoyance

3 was definitely the one I was hoping Icefrog would give to Dire .
How many heroes can actually pull the off - lane creeps on Radiant though ?
? Anyone with a tango ?
every single one . all you need is a tango and a brain .
Who ?
20 threads seconds after he said that but this is speculation that isnt exactly new . Reddit will be reddit .
Babaev also said last night that armlet isnt getting changed . So Im guessing some pro players / personalities have some indications on what will be in the patch notes .
Babaev said armlet was getting a buff
Got a link to the vod ?
How would that work though ? Pull through ancients ? pull Roshan to your lane ?
Moving the camp in Radiant jungle that is closest to Roshan 's pit closer to the safelane , so it can be pulled by Dire offlane .
OSfrog are you ready for my new crazy ideas ? OSfrog
Nah , I doubt he is in contact with Icefrog even if this is slightly true . Probably heard it from a pro player who has contact with IF .
Well he does nt really like any Asians besides the Chinese though .
I always thought South American mangoes were supposed to be the best .
And since Icefrog loves China . That only helps his case .

And then Alliance will come to starladder and not win a single game
The only LAN win they have this * season is against C9 .
this season *

And this became relevant again .
Jesus this is a close group stage .
Who would imagine OG getting last place in the group stage right after winning the major ?
Yeah I do nt think I can watch anymore Dota for today after that game , goddamn that was dirty as hell .
Someone gets it , Furion is actually shit this patch . Alliance 's record with him is poor .
OG with Moon plays him
Has nt in a while , and when he did , they were winning in spite of the NP , not because of it .
definitely agree with u . he is nt well suited against these run - at - u style meta heroes like tusk and slardar , doesnt give enough to the team in those early - midgame scrappy fights . that said icefrog loves nerfing these cheese strats and it wouldnt shock me if this is not viable at all next patch
Yeah he is nt that 's why I do nt get all these talks about nerfing him even more . Lol
Before NP got Octarine , his score was 1 / 8 heh . And he ended up at 3 / 12 IIRC )
over 1100 cs on a viper what even .
Treants . A lot of them .
he activated his inner timbersaw and cut down all the dog 's trees .
too bad networth doesnt mean anything when u have no buildings .
Poor Virtus Pro . That was painful to watch .
VP did not respect Furion and picked 2 heroes who cant clear waves efficiently . That cost them a game .
Yeah , it was actually quite a good furion pick . Ca nt say the hero has been working out well for them all that much lately , but in this case it did .
i d just like to add that while you re absolutely right , vp did have a great chance to win the game , they just missed their timing window ( the key moment i think is like u pointed out when they didnt push when alliance did nt have buybacks and vp already had 3 heroes at mid t3 ) its rough talking with hindsight , but i think vp 's draft was definitely not an issue , nor was their early - mid game play
? it was nt about not having the waveclear . the amount of catch ( slardar & tusk ) they had made it such a horribly painful game for bulldog . he literally was like 1 - 8 or something i think . VP had a strat , they just missed their timing window . if anything i think they were a bit too respectful , not pushing at one crucial stage when loda / bulldong ( i forget which ) was dead without buyback .
it was definitely a very painful game for bulldog i assure you that
The rat is real
My reaction as an Alliance fan :
rats
This was a heinous and cowardly act .
You mean that was beautiful
Defending the base for an hour , with no hope of winning . Literally Dota hell . This should be LPQ .
This is worse than the slow rad - octarine - manta naga siege
Would just like to remind everyone

Ah , the good ol ' monthly watch I get of this when Alliance wins a match .
yearly *
RAT DOTO

It was nt beautiful but it got the job done .
Alliance should keep doing this now and then to force out respect bans for Furion .
lmfao butthurt people incoming
Still , it was beautiful to watch . Long live the rat .
Because most people here are Navi , Liquid fangays who ca nt get over TI3 . The salt is still flowing 3 years later
ResidentSleeper
With that win , Alliance are guaranteed a spot in Starladder / i - League . The next series between VP and Na Vi determines who gets the second slot . OG have no chance of getting through to the tournament in this phase , but they have another shot in the Last Chance phase .
MyNuts was left . Illidan was right .
Bulldog , Silent , G and FNG now have top CS on their respective heroes .
is gonna be long time before someone breaks that that new dazzle 682 cs record

Fun af match dude . Real fun .
YOU ARE NEVER BACK
What now VP fangays ? 4Head
A heinous and cowardly act
That aint a compliment .
Reading all the salty hatred after an Alliance game reminds me why I love this team xD
The hate is real .
many moments there were , where i just wanted alliance to throw to just end the game
I was rooting for vp but holy shit I d forgotten how much I love r [ a ] t games .

I am actually glad VP got to play the 3rd game and did nt gg out .
They learned a lot just from this . You ca nt always ban NP so you have to learn and play against him . I see VP only only getting stronger after this
thats true they took good measures against the rat , its just that alliance was very patient and disciplined to not throw . so many cs records broken
is there vod ? I wanna see this
I feel like G 's itemisation cost them 3 opportunities to punch through to alliance 's base . the butterfly on top of the satanic seemed a bit much to me when they needed to clear creep waves . but i m just a scrub
VP did nt ever commit and that 's what lost them the game .
I honestly thought wisp was the thing that killed VP . so many relocate saves on caught out heroes . Akke keeping Loda from throwing
VOD maybe ?
Mynuts was left .
ResidentSleeper
Alliance is the one of the few teams that play this style and i think one of the best teams in lategame mostly to s4 as captain . I just love the lategame Decision making from Alliance .
That was a surprisingly boring game :
this thread may be the most downvoted thread ever

You are playing against Alliance . You do not ban Furion because you can counter it . Alliance instantly picks Furion . You lose against Alliance . You ban Furion next time you play against Alliance because you re not stupid .

Still not better than VS . Liquid .
I feel bad for VP but man ! I do enjoy the occasional rat game !
oh boy that felt good .
You are playing against Alliance .
You do not ban Furion because you can end the game early .
Alliance instantly picks Furion .
You lose late game against Alliance .
If Navi loses to VP , we can confirm : Alliance > VP > navi > OG
The downvotes are quick lmfao .
Using gay as an insult in 2015 ? Are you even trying ?
Alliance is disgusting
I watched that whole 3rd match . I can say this now : if that type of gameplay is what it takes for Alliance to be back , I hope Alliance is never back again . That was just so fucking awful .
Alliance could play literally any comp at any given time at TI3 and before that , they did nt just rat .
So as Alliance they should have called GG instead ?
I now officially hate Alliance . It took me all that time since TI3 finals , but I finally arrived at the point of no return .
Fuck rats . May you forever rot in lower bracket .

That is what happens when you have Viper - Slardar - Tusk as your 3 cores . Slardar should never be run as your safelane hero unless you have a SF , TA , or some other hard carry in the mid lane .
Or you just flat out win before 20 min . You know there are different approaches to winning .
no , you are supposed to kill them alot and let them call gg , thats the only fair way to win / s
I would imagine this is nt a popular opinion but I feel like if G had gone for mek , got rosh , pushed they could have ended the game before NP got out of control .
such a boring strat
Seriously , this shit is disgusting , i do nt know how can anyone be a fan of this team . FUCK ALLIANCE .
Well Alliance did not deserve that win .
Game is not a killing competition . They got the throne , VP could nt deal with that strategy . Game is not a killing competition . Game is not a killing competition . Game is not a killing competition .

Hey Loda , I m trying to learn to play Tusk . I just have a question about the skill build . Should I max Ice Shards like how you isolated Mynuts from the rest of the team , Snowball like your ego has gotten out of control , or should I buy Aghs so I can use Walrus Kick like how you kicked Mynuts .
This actually is so bad FailFish

I would go sprint , maybe 3 points in it and max bash after that - its up to you really yes I am responding seriously to this . I feel like 3 is enough to be close to max speed anyway and a few points in bash might be worth it rather than move speed at level 10 +

,
I love this bot so much !
So much win !
S4 is so inconsistent , this guy needs a sports psychologist
And I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
even in his inconsistency , he is still a tier above everyone else on Alliance
That 's because he is God - Tier ( when he wants to ) but Bulldong 's is pretty good too .
you make it sound like an achievement
S4 will always be Tier1 . so 2 tiers above loda or bulldog
I hope Loda does what Fear did and switch to position 4 now that Nuts is gone so [ A ] can picks up a new carry player .
Agreed , but loda fangays will downvote I guess
Thats like 4 tiers above Loda .
Without a doubt
1 word : bubu
I hope puck gets a buff so we can see S4 play it .
S4 Kreygasm
Just before this happened there was another gank on tiny where wisp managed to save him and I thought to myself " would nt it be cool if he had canceled the relocate with flamebreak ? I suppose it 's only possible in theory though since you do nt know the exact timing on the wisp save , and you gotta time it right etc "
Then that happened .
Exactly my thoughts ! This game is crazy !
you can see exactly when wisp starts a relocate . there 's an animation .
i believe he means on the tether , by the time you see wisp approaching you ve missed the opportunity to flamebreak him away due to the skill 's travel time .
If you did nt notice
Which is what mattered most here , the tether doesnt even matter
if it didnt cancel the ult but it canceled the tether it would end up the same . The ult is the one which didnt matter .
Are you serious ?
s4 is the true S - God and has always been !
With everyone else you think " If I tried my hardest , I could eventually do that "
With S4 , I ca nt even imagine it .
Really next level tbh
Uhm , no .
They had vision on the wisp .
Watch the replay .
The funny thing is , Wisp did nt react immediately ( or had cd ) and he calculated that delay , too . Lucky and impressive xD
I think the delay was a prevention of a wisp relocate tether , because you usually channel relocate first so there tends to be a delay with the tether
He did nt predict anything , he knew wisp was there so he tried to knock him back . He just got lucky timing .
That sounds like a prediction to me .
He did nt time the flamebreak to cancel the tether like so many people in this thread seem to believe . There 's just no way .
You realise you re watching pro players , right ?
Really ? I thought I was watching Alliance .
i think he just knows the delay upon casting relocate and timed it that way
Here we go
he canceled relocate too

Nice play . for a grill < 3
inb4 Black !
Tether cancel ?
He cancelled the relocate .





























And Black 's world tour continues !
Black confirmed to join Pain Gaming to star on the new brazilian dota team
" Team doesnt work ? Kick Black , I bet that will solve it "
He is always the outsider of every team , he puts himself into those situations . Teams will always blame the outsider regardless of how logical it is or is nt .
Hence the MyNuts situation today as well .
team my black nuts

Also SingSing 's last team iirc .
Kinda think that is 4CL .
Pajkatt the ex dog / mouz / alliance
EGM + Niqua the ex Alliance
Bamboe the Ex - Zephyr
Zephyr
My brand !
I think I m a little special
About that .
relevant username
the most outsider of that team is gonna be real sad .
Team Tinker 2 . 0
Man I love Black ^ but he needs to go to the west and stay in the west where he can build his reputation slowly and steadily .
June and Inflame have been disappointing , unfortunately .
Well , this is the trade period .
What do you think this period is ?
Who 's to say he has nt already been looking and maybe already found something ?
Have what happen ? Get kicked ? There 's far too many instances of that happening to narrow it down to just alliance moves .
Maybe there 's a reason for it .
There are 2 :
His late - game decisions are questionable most of the time . And I say this as a Black ^ fan :
So maybe he actually is a problem . I d stop speculating when you hav nt played a single game with him .
I m sure he does nt mind .
Incredible how , can somehow convince itself that it 's every team being stupid and not just black ^ being an incredibly mediocre player .
Nah man black is the hardest farmer the west has to offer and that 's totally a benefit in dota 2 today .
they kick him because he is Black
It really does nt happen like that in life
If you have a problem with 10 different people at 10 different times , then you re the problem
Black ^ gets kicked because he 's :
Black goes Black ? He might never come back .

There ll be another move coming .

,

its for ky . xy and xtinct 90 % sure .
Can ky . xy communicate in English tho ?
Brax ?
Tier 1 , not tier shit
Brax is nt shit lol
1 is black , the other one has to be someone from SG / MY
i doubt it someone from fnatic
Sounds like MyNuts to me .
Nope , it 's xtinct
Second is probably Xtinct . Since Xtinct appears to be out of VG . P
yea seems so , xtinct already back to malaysia
the other one that came to my head is kyxy but i dont think he 's at malaysia right now
its mynuts
Black ^ also tweeted this :

,

Black ^ SingSing + MyNuts + 2
But who do you kick when things start going badly ?
Black ^ of course , like always .
But he 's the one you kick when you re playing and placing well but not quite winning !
BibleThump
Just disband
EE
Win TI .
I havent followed the scene either , but i play sometimes with him . And it didnt sound like he would consider another go .
Thanks for the info

Illidan + 1
Well as much as i like Sing 's stream he is like sQreen of EU
Illidan
Who else got kicked recently ?
Poor mynuts
qojqva return Keepo
Best T3 team of all time .
I m glad Black is out of Fnatic . That team is a disaster . Mushi cannot draft to save his life . He 's become such a weak link that he 's switched to support .
I ve said it before but Fnatic need Winter , or someone very similar . He 's skilled at drafting and would make a good leader / captain , which is what they need . He d also be a good 5 which would allow their 3 cores to actually play as cores .
He is playing core .
Now he is , but during the Major he played support ( at least some matches , I did nt watch all )
sounds exactly like how VG worked with black pre DAC
and it was successful for a bit . until people / competition eventually got better and VG could nt 4v5 anymore
His point is nt that Black ^ was nt playing poor , his point is that all of Fnatic was playing poor because their team dynamic does nt work .
Honestly , Black , Mynuts and 3 more would be a pretty sick European team . I do nt think it will ever work out with Black on Chinese or SEA teams so I think he should at least try to work it out with a team closer to his native culture or language .
no roster changes Kappa
Same with vp as fng said or alliance as Kelly said . Keepo
Mushi - Team wo nt change .
I wonder what happened
WutFace
He learned lots from Mushi during his time there .
how the fuck are people downvoting this . this is hilarious
Honestly at this point I think he 's doing this just so he can go on a world tour without having to pay for it himself .
SEA done , time for CIS region now for Black ^
He needs to try out on a CIS team as well .
smash is better than black ^
Smash plays pos 2
Smash plays a different role to Black though .
But yeah he is better .
Pretty unexpected .
I really want to see Black ^ succeding , but damn , he seems to run always into teams that end up disbanding or kicking him
Poor guy , Jesus , I swear if he gets kicked again I will make a team of my 3k friends and ask him to be our carry . He can play AM , I do nt mind , but we will qualify for TI6 or next Major whatever it is , for fucking sure .
/ s ?
He has delivered on some big stages . At worst , he 's inconsistent .
First ,
Also , keep fighting the good fight , s " is used for idiots by idiots .
Have you watched him play ? Hes a very good player . I watched almost all his VG matches and still dont know why they kicked him ( I still think it was because he wasnt Asian and yes Im Asian too I know how it goes )
Like someone else said hes an outsider and they are the easiest to let go if things arent working and a good fix isnt obvious .
they re basically like the 2014 post ti c9 with a bit more individual skill .
outside of EE being a better player sure .
except black is way worse as a player , he just has no impact in his games . He farms and does nt die , but when it comes to it he does nt make a big difference in the games where he gets a big amount of farm .
in league of legends or irl ?
Because connections to people do nt mean anything .
He wanted to be a mid player originally his farming was too good to stop being a carry . He has played mid in tournament for several teams .
Qoyjva picked it . Black ^ took QoP .
Net and Xtinct ?
please let there be no kappa
Please Black ^ sama can I stop changing my flair
BL [ A ] CK
Is it only me when read " Thank you Black " immediately thinks about kick ?
4 Pros + Synderen
That looks like a team that would lose a lot of Dota games
black should do full time streaming he is very funny to listen to and great to watch
Wow , first mynuts then Black , right before the roster lock . What the hell is happening in pro dota right now ?
Return of KyXy perhaps ?
I wonder if he would fit in at DC .
Anyone got a text mirror for those of us at work ?
cant wait to see what region he is gonna fail in next , 4 down 3 to go
In Black ^ we trust !
Black ^ kicked from team after one major yet again :
Time for black to go back to EU .
its because the meta didnt suit him
so : black + mynuts + illidan + new team
Still do nt understand why fnatic did nt pick up an EU team . Surely there are better EU stacks than this current fnatic ?
Someone give Black a chance , that guy deserves it .
I am kinda sad that he ca nt get established team . He is good . He just ca nt . fit ? Sadly .
Calling it now , Black will return with Qojqva
In before FNATIC have a worse performance now and do nt qualify for the next major out of SEA .
MyNuts
Illidan
Black ^
Who are other members ?
Niqua
so sad to see him leave yet another team . always a pleasure to watch him rice farm lol
I m sad . But people need to get over with roster changes . It happens all the time . I hope Black ^ can find a decent team that can follow his own pace like the old vici gaming . Edit spelling
This info might be skewed with people coming to the conclusion that " hero dmg / KDA doesnt mean everything " but for this to be a consistent stat , you gotta realize that at that Time VG was nt a 5v5 type of team , more like a 4 + 1 ? vs 5
I guess once you go with Black ^ you quickly go back .
Man . I really hope finally finds the team he deserves and wins something big
Kick matumba and bring in liquid . black
Black to alliance , calling it
Fnatic . Illidan ?
The black ^ number increases
Should nt it decrease ( once the joins a new team )
Fnatic . kyxy or meracle
Ye cause Mushi was never the problem ( Y )
Good move , Black ^ is good at farming , not at winning games . One of the most overrated carries in Dota 2 .
Damn that sucks for him . He seems like such a cool dude , but that does nt translate into good playing . I have nt watched any Fnatic games post - TI , how has his playing been ?
Mushi used to be godlike though , IDK what the fuck is up with him . Hopefully he can come back though , sad to see the legends fall . At least Fear + Chaun + Puppey + Chaun + Misery etc is still kicking strongly , even if Burning looks like he 's starting to drop off .
His time at VG was great , they won a lot . Then they kicked him ans now they do nt look so good .
I think Black ^ is one of the best carries out there , but he needs a team that supports him and that does nt view him as an outsider .





























I like the steak , but the text take too much room .
Compare it to the other team logos , a logo should be a logo not a text message .
Maybe call them SG for short and only put that in the steak ?
> Well Done !
It 's rare to get quality logos like this for free .
I hope the team gets no beef with this design
This is pretty good . I can see them using this if they do nt already have a logo
If they want to use it I would make some nice banners and map stones also . I did nt mention that in the post I guess .
This was a quick deal , if they decided they wanted to use it I would nt be opposed to cleaning it up . I totally get what your saying though .
As for what I like . The T in the steak is great stuff , and pretty much sold it for me .
Its a great proof of concept . And it doesnt seem OP is trying to pretend its anything else .
Cool ! I d like to see some suggestions for banners and ground , too . Please PM me if you design some . Thanks for taking the time :

Perfect .
Still needs ,
That 's a well done steak !

are you a dad ? you sound like a dad .

But is that the 0 . 1 % cut from the cow ?

It 's literally the same steak

That 's actually awesome ! Hope they use it man !
Nice T - Bone steak mate
Can someone fill me in as to what this logo refers to ? I ve been disconnected for the past two days , so I m out of the loop .
You throw one of the most high end beef cuts to your dog ? Must be nice .
wtf is steak gaming ?
Synderen 's new team .
Upvoted for visibility
This is honestly one of the best logos I ve seen .
Oh I get it
I hope they perform as good as they logo
Nice logo did they name their team after the Moon steak memes ?
Imagine if Steak Gaming qualified to major , that would mean no Synderen or Blitz casts
How it is Steak Gaming and Moon is nt on it ?
SeemsGood
SeemsGood
you should make the steak a cow and RL choking it to make it a steak
I remember this from some cartoon . Which one ?
Imagine if Steak Gaming qualified to major , that would make for a better logo .
The background needs to be another color while keeping the font white I think .
The logo lacks some synderen in it
If they do nt use this they should just disband and give up
I took literally a minute .

This logo : 7 / 10
This logo with rice : 10 / 10 !

oh that FeelsBadMan hope that volvo will invite him for the desk

Apparently I m an idiot .
No that was Niqua .
:
wow . FeelsBadMan
Oh God . FeelsBadMan
They got too personal inside the team , they will never kick any of the old members
i doubt kicking mynuts will solve their problems .
nt alliance .
this was really really good
Only a full disband , will help the name Alliance . Because Loda will never get kicked .
They should try out that kid with a funny name , MyNuts or smth like that
I heard EGM was good too . Then again 7ckingmad is pretty good too .
Fucking navi
Or akke either , who has been really average for a long while now , but most people do nt notice support play as much as carry
He 's just very . Passive .
Even ppd in defensive supports has ways of making himself known in the first few minutes of the game and you never really forget about him through the mid game . Akke I do nt think about after the first few waves basically .
I think you are spot on .
just like old navi ?

Just going to leave this here
good way to get into the Pro circles tho . so hopefully they can find a new team afterwards like NiP or smaller teams
Yea its basically like EG and old navi . u stick around with ur friends . While Puppey , notail and others have the courage to step out the comfort zone and make a change
If you re EG then I do nt really think you should be trying to change things up too much anyway .
Despite them not winning the recent major , they still made top 3 . They ve consistently been one of the best teams in the world for the last year and a few months .
He probably meant eg with demon and fear bromance
most of us prefer to forget that
weird
Maybe Loda should spent time playing the game instead of being beat up by RL
Makes you want to choke somebody , eh ?
It 's ok , we will just keep rotating supports until our carry gets better , makes perfect sense .
Especially since MyNuts has been looking much better than Akke lately .
How could you know that before knowing who the replacement is ?
I mean , it looks kinda bad but it also depends on who the replacement is .
:
,
Seems Alliance just lost their nuts
Nah bulldog did nt die to niqua .
Savage
Not to be a dick or anything , but at what point does the logical move become to just kick the other 4 and rebuild around new blood ?
because we cant be that far off it now
I did nt even think Niqua , Mynuts , Misery or Pajkatt were the problem .
But anyways , Alliance will be bringing in new Swedish talent : EGM of course .
EDIT : Kebap is standing in for him at the moment . I hope this is nt permanent , because I actually like Kebap .
4CL does nt provide salary though . But I do agree that 4CL have been steadily improving recently .
Neither will Alliance if this level of performance continues ( at least not to this roster )
From my understanding Misery did nt want to play with alliance because they did nt know if Chessie would be able to play / could nt find a stable replacement for Chessie .
Good decision . Now he is in a better team .
Misery was not kicked , he got fed up with all the standins after Chessie had his injury and he got an offer from Secret . Kicking Niqua for Bulldog was a logical move , Bulldog was definitely an improvement over him .
Pajkatt is probably one of the best mids in Europe and his play was not a problem , but there 's always been rumors about him and Loda having issues with each other . You do nt kick players based solely on their performance ingame , how they act and communicate is important as well ( Aui being kicked from EG for example )
Unless there was some major communication issues with Mynuts , I have no idea how they kicked him over Akke . Guess they would rather be a team of 4 friends than a successful team .
That should be the wise move but I doubt they ll kick Loda and Akke . Oh well , feel bad for Mynuts , did nt see it coming :
Alliance is basically Loda + Akke . But s4 and bulldog has been around for along time so it 's basically Loda s4 bulldog akke + 1 .
I do nt think this will ever happen ( to the degree of other sports ) unless we start getting more region specific
If you re kicking Loda and Akke , you might as well just disband altogether . Like Na Vi , Alliance is not Alliance without them .
Like Na Vi without XBOCT ?
How many times can they kick the same person ? Getting ridiculous
Does anyone know whose the one calling the shot ingame ( mostly ? and who drafts ?

As , said below
Pretty sure it 's s4 thats the captain which means he makes the calls but all carries lategame lead because they re the strongest and know the limits of their heroes .
drafting is s4
in game shots is s4 and loda
outside the game i assume all have a say , but loda is the " leader " not surprising when we see these moves . niqua first now mynuts
I do nt really pay close attention to all of their games but I thought Nuts was the most consistently good player on the team lately .
I always thought the same as well . It seems like even in some of the bad games Alliance played over the past few weeks , Nuts had been doing pretty well pretty often .
I do nt think kicking a 4 pos player over and over again is a key to success , but whatever . It 's getting harder to root for them tho .
They did it again ?
If you forgot , Niqua got kicked to make space for Admiral Bulldog right before the roster locks for TI5 if I recall correctly . Much , much worse than how AUI was kicked .
Aui kick was actually the best way to kick somebody . When hes winning and getting money
And right after the major / TI to allow the most amount of time to find a new team .
People only got mad about AUI getting kicked because EG won TI with him , PPD even made a statement why they thought he should get kicked ( which he in no way had to ) and did it way before the lock so AUI can find a team .
People dont get as mad about the times Alliance kicks their players because they have nt achieved shit anyways so people just joke about them . because they are a joke at this point .
Indeed , fuck Alliance
No , it 's Alliance 's fault for not doing it sooner . I m pretty sure MyNuts could ve been part of Era 's new team instead of Fogged . Now there 's no options left .
official statement :
Johan had the following to say as hes leaving the team :
Jonathan Loda Berg , Team Captain of the Alliance Dota team wanted to say the following :
I wish Johan all the best in the future , and I know that sooner or later well face each other on the battlefield again .
Yes . It seems like that . Especially because mynuts tweeted that he can be mynuts again .
Yeah it seems like it .

Id like to see them rebuild around s4 and bulldog personally
Welcome back EGM or Mad , until next shuffle
please not mad
pls not EGM either
If they bring Mad back Im just going to stop watching their games
Honestly aui kick was the best kick ever done in terms of situation . They waited till after TI5 in which aui gets money , fame , and a lot of time to find rosters
Exactly it 's not like MyNuts is swimming in prize money from his time at Alliance and I think the timing of the kick is awful
I did nt see that one coming .
Really ? Bad performance and other 4 members are immune to getting kicked .
Yeah damn Handsken caught a lucky break , I m sure Swindle would ve instantly snatched up Mynuts if he was kicked a week earlier
Handsken is decent , but CoL with mynuts has the potential to be the best NA team , especially considering that they have a history of working really well with each other .
Idk about announcing that adding Handsken then kicking him when MyNuts is available as a replacement a week or so later is an " easy thing " It d shit on the whole Col organization as a whole .
What a meme
Are they really an NA team when 3 / 5 of them are Swedish ?
He still has time to sub for CoL . I think he might be doing so even .
Interesting to see who is going to stand in vs VP in 10 mins .
Synderen ?
Synderen has a team though .
Damn that was unexpected , and only 5 days until roster lock .
Alliance must have someone already in mind , and now MyNuts needs to find a new team before then :
The last team i expected a shuffle for . MyNuts has played as well as / better than any other Alliance player in the past 4 months and this is absurd . I m inclined to believe that Alliance are in touch with some star name pos 4 player , because otherwise it doesnt make sense this move .
MyNuts was nt the problem .
I thought he was the most consistent one out of all of them . S4 and Loda make too many critical errors and I feel like Akke just does nt really stand out anymore .
Akke is just like a big creep .
What the fuck ?
Mynuts has several times proved to be an excellent player .
Alliance is still at the point where the old players think the problem is not them , same shit Na Vi did for two years , they keep kicking new players they bring in instead of simply disbanding .
At one point GGA will get tired of this shit and simply dismantle the team , i do nt see them getting any LAN wins or top placements , even with s4 .
Pretty much this . Guess it 's time to remove my flair .
the burn
savage
That was fast : D
Why would they disband ? They get salary , get to go to some lan events etc . If the old players are really bad , then they will not get a new team and will have to move on from esports . As long as they keep qualifying for lans and majors ( which Alliance did ) there is no point in disbanding as long as they get money .
Which Alliance failed to do for a lot of the LANs these past two years .
GGA does nt want a team that qualifies to LANs , they want a team that is successful , and i m sure Alliance players feel the same way .
I hope Illidan + Mynuts form a team and win TI6 together BibleThump
Richard Lewis is his replacement
XBOCT !
Mynuts was not the problem with this team . Alliance officially has Na Vi syndrome . They keep replacing the parts that are nt broken . It 's your 1 that 's holding you back Alliance . Sorry dudes .
Do nt worry , I m sure he will choke enough to get cut one of these days .

Kelly has nt been Alliance 's manager for a while now .
like he only has a couple of days to find a team now , if they kicked him after majors he might be on team with Era and Synd instead of Fogged maybe or another team w / e .
Yup , and minimal time to find a new team . _ ( _ /
Only Jonassomfan who is nt on a team , that would mean role swap .
While I have nt been impressed by mynuts ' individual play , I think the same goes for at least Loda and Bulldog . But then again , what looks like poor individual talent are often times internal issues .
Great . they kicked their most stable player .
I dont know who they can replace him with that will perform even remotely aswell as he did with Alliance .
With his tusk - play and support qop , MyNuts actually gave alliance an edge that pretty much no one else in the team offered . He was not the problem with that team .
jesus
UncleNox IM UncleNox NOT UncleNox THE UncleNox PROBLEM UncleNox
Everyone is expecting a new support player .
No EE confirmed in an interview that there was a chance it would be 1 . RTZ 2 . EE 3 . maybe misery 4 . s4 5 . Puppey lineup but s4 left for alliance and rtz for EG so it did nt work out .
If he wanted that why did nt they just let him do it with Arteezy mid and Kuro back on carry ?
I do nt think it was confirmed that he seriously considered it .
According to EE there was a serious chance that could ve happened .
Akke was unhappy with the lack of female representation in the team , probably Zai position 4 incoming to help this issue while keeping the all swedish lineup .

always relevant
WTF , He was nt playing bad . What 's up with this ?
Damn it Alliance . Why do you do this to me ? I really think that at this point the best move would be for Loda to step away and become the coach for the team , and bring in a more modern carry . Go back and steal Pajkatt and Mad , get a new 1 + 4 , and you re suddenly a much more competitive team IMO
s4 wasting another year when he could have been in a top t1 team .
Also , fully expect Alliance to pick up someone from the old NIP lineup . Handsken ?
( tweet from 1 month ago )

,

so who will be his replacement . rosters gonna lock soon
EGM 4Head
I was thinking the exact same . I do nt think EGM wants to leave 4CL though , they ve been looking quite decent . Even though Alliance does pay salary .
Honestly , I was thinking the same . EGM has really improved compared to a year ago .
RL was right ! I knew it
MyNuts has literally been the best player on Alliance since he joined . What in the actual fuck ?
Wow odd . Wonder who they get . Someone from NiP or go back to Mad ? They were nt doing bad .
God damn , MyNuts got kicked :
Im just waiting for the ppd tweet
Alliance is back . to the dumpster
Hello drama my old friend .

yea blink is nt a core at all on this hero
yeah because ursa doesnt blink in to kill you and blink has 0 sec cd
ursa confirmed viable
it has almost double the cooldown and is more expensive
exactly ! kappa
What a 2k post this is . Just because he buys blink does nt mean force is bad against him .
yeah just get 1500 gold out of nowhere
yah this item is really not bought enough by supports ( im guilty of this sometimes aswell )
and then he buys bkb anyway .
Eul is a counter - initiation for early - mid game , if Ursa rush BKB he is a stupid and you will win , if it is late game you can still have the Eul and it will work ,
Unless the whole enemy team make shadow blade or blademail and you team keep feeding and ignoring dust spamming the chat with " We need wards " oh the horror .
Hey ghost form is nt dispelled by TPs anymore , might want to edit that
Ty for actually reading patch notes .
Also it 's + 5 all stats not + 7
Welp , RIP all those time recently where I ve had Ghost Scepter and did nt bother using it using it then TP while being 1 hit away from death .
Never tried this , but in theory could work on Legion Commander against physical damage dealers . You still attack in duel when ethereal , but enemies ca nt actually hit you .
Still think its better to let them kill themselves with your blademail .
Arteezy 's new favorite item on ember against right clickers
NotLikeThis
Buy Dagon to counter this !
I hate getting this . It 's like BKB , unless I ll lose the game without it and there 's no other option , I ll never get it . I always prefer something along the lines of Force / Glimmer / Solar
I get it so I can dive fountain / 10
How well does this work on Medusa , especially with spells being cast against her Mana Shield ?
Literally just won a game where the riki who jump on me all game died after I ghost scepter + glimmer + freezing field right after force staff from smoke
6 . 84 nerfs to ghost scepter hurt pretty bad , but the removal of diffusal cooldown hurts the most .
You can now activate it and TP right away , meaning that Ursa / Riki / Clinkz / etc ca nt just wait 4 seconds to then kill you .
Gl with that against riki .
it is also cheaper , making it easier for supports to buy it
it 's largely considered buffed in 6 . 84 . not nerfed .
ghost is built on supports or heroes that do nt make armour but need to survive v right click , because they ca nt afford or make very little use of armour . therefore the cost reduction was considered worth it over the loss of stats as you buy it for the active . The cost reduction also buffed eblade and eblade carriers .
The ability to TP with ghost was a straight up buff .
especially on cm , dazzle and lion
it is fucking legit on Lion , back before I got bored with Lion I got it every time when others bought Aghs .
the damage amp is insane when he can combo everything
NO
I can see .
no
This item sounds great for supports on paper , but it 's usually worse than getting forcestaff or glimmer for the sole reason that you can save your allies with it .
If this item did nt need you to save up 1 . 5k gold on a support at once to buy it , then you would see it more .
Yeah , cuz the enemy has a diffusal every game .
Fixed . Sorry about that . I thought I had fixed all this but did everything in haste .
,
We re late for this discussion

Whoops oh man . There 's a ton of errors with this one . I did it in haste . Sorry
I hope E - blade becomes more accessible for supports . E - blade is a really good item to save your allies against heavy right - clickers but its really expensive for supports right now .
There are haldberd , glimmer , force and solar for that . 40 agility does nt sound like a defensive support item .
My favorite thing to do when the enemies get ghost scepters is to get a diffusal blade and continue to gank them .
patch notes pls
Thanks , it 's fixed . I thought I fixed all the outdated stuff but I went too quick .
makes right clickers too afraid to attack you
makes ursa , juggernaut , and ta cry
use it against gyro and you will surely die
?
Fixed . Thanks . This post was done in haste , I thought I removed the outdated info .
- no longer dispells ensnare
Rip .
does embers SoF still hit you when you re in ghost form ?
Ghost Scepter needs to purge debuffs / slows / roots for it to be worth it as a self - targeting only item that has a built in counter ( increased magic damage )
Ghost Scepter only costs 1500 since a few patches . It also doesnt give + 7 stats anymore .
Since that is nt clear , it now gives + 5 to stats
Not exactly about ghost scepter , but Eblade is kinda agility version of haldberd . Good item against WR if you re an agility carry that benefits from attack speed .
You know you re truly at Reddit 8k MMR when you buy this item against a PA or an Ursa and you remember to use it and it saves your life .
reddit 8k wtf ? it was 9k like 5 weeks ago
Inb4 all the edgy " i must crack a joke at all cost " shits .
Do nt really know how i feel about this with glimmer cape in the game .
Best item to put and click in quickbuy before you die .
but moonshard ?
I mean , if I play as a support , I would nt even consider putting moonshard in my quickbuy slot at all , lol .
My two favorite heroes , Riki and Morph , at least can upgrade it into eblade if for whatever reason I misclicked the quickbuy button . And ghost scepter is never bad on supports as well .
lol that was a joke , i was kidding , my team disruptor bought a moonshard afterall !
You ca nt quickbuy moonshard unless you have your courier in the secret shop at all times .
ikr , i was just kidding !
This item is NEVER bought in 2k mmr where i am , unless its for E blade Dagon bounty Hunter .
I thought that was changed
This seems outdated as fuck . Do you even play the game ?
Yes I do . This post was done in haste . I m sorry about that .
this item is back , to the dumpster u guys
