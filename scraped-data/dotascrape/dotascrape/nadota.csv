						"

							I mean meepo is always gonna be ""broken"" against low skill players when played by someone decent,
,
it's the nature of a hero with 1) split push 2) farm fast 3) solo kill potential 4) can solo rosh,
,
huskar is completely different. regardless of the skill level huskar always has the potential to just become an unkillable frontliner that breaks base with an aegis at 20-25 minutes, and without the right heroes you just can't really do anything about it unless you aggroed into the huskar or abused his weak laning phase.

						"

							also valve itself mentioned that they wanted to make the 6.85 patch after the ESL major, which would be actually really close to 6.85, which means now they want to realize patches in a fast pace, maybe each major there will be a balance patch it would make sense because those tournaments are bigger than summit,starlader etc
						"

							how would u nerf him?,

would u just nerf his numbers to hurt his laningor would u put some sort of leash on his fire spirit so it doesnt work if u are too far away or a small cast animation on his escape

						"

Yeah it's a top tier hero, but if you just nerf and nerf the instant something's good without thinking you create other issues. There's still (decent) heroes that are good against him (Huskar, Bone fletcher, Drow, Jugg, PA, Doom, DK, Invoker)

							Not sure if people do this yet but because crits for WK, CK, and PA are pseudo random you can just jungle until you do not get a crit for ~7 hits in a row and then have like an 85% chance to crit on your next attack. Just stop jungling if you see it happen and go kill a support. ,

							in DTS v Na'vi, physical dps was way more effective than it should have been since neither team had armor items like vlads. In particular, and I don't know why, Light didn't get a cuirass so he was running around with 4k hp in rage mode with 4.7 armor. That's why they could right click him down so fast when they medallioned him. ,

But you shouldnt be casting if you cant get the viewers pumped over things. why do you think I almost never play dota anymore? Its exactly why the viewers got mad at you...

							So, I just got partnered up with justin.tv, which means I get half of any ad money they make.  I definitely want to be streaming more now - for my own channel I won't be doing official Gosugamers casts, but anything from IHL games to scrims I'll do there (as well as like non-GG events like Dotacash tourneys, etc).  If I ever actually see any money I'll definitely put it back towards nadota in the form of prize money or similar, but I need your help.,
,
1. I want to be able to stream more people playing clanwars.  Right now only VT exists afaik, but if there are scrims on the various IHL's that are worth streaming, please let me know.  You can PM me here in advance, or find me on Jizzle's vent most nights.,
2. What else would you guys actually watch?  I know a lot of you probably wouldn't mind watching stuff when you're unable to play at like work or class (lol).,
3. Co-casters - either people who want to cast with me, or people wanting to stream who will use my channel when I'm not.  In the latter case, I'll obviously give you your share of any revenue money that I receive if you stream and actually get viewers.,
4. I want to start having regular streaming sessions, right now it's pretty random when I feel like it but this makes me actually wanna stream at least a few times a week.,
,
Basically guys, I want to find some way of building some revenue to use for the nadota community, I hope you're willing to help and give me some ideas, and I especially need suggestions on what to stream.  Let me know.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							you could stream some of the mym.cl/SFG/ADL games,
also do u usually have music playing while ur casting? i hate it when people dont do that its so dull
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							for some reason theres up to 600 people watching a stream of a highlevel inhouse in hon.... if you're interested 5-s
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Yep, I plan on having epic music in the background.  Powernet - let me know when I can stream any games that might be interesting, like I've said if I ever make any money off this I'll put it back towards nadota here.  Brax: I know, and it's cuz hon has been doing this for a lot longer than we have.  I think it's possible to build up an audience for dota too (hell, I've gotten over 9000 people watching russians play a match before) - but I think it won't happen unless we start strategizing as a community about how to do it better.
						"

							,thats pretty easy get casters that have a fucking personality not bland ass chink carpet constructers like broodstar
						"

							LOL GO AWAY JUBEI SENILE ANGRY OLD MAN OF NADOTA
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							as long as you stream any hs-proffesional game, and put it on the frontpage of websites, you'll have many views. Try to catch a stream of a chinese game, you get wayyy more viewers instead of random na/eu team. If worth investing, you should attend ESWC or SMNGT 2011 and cast these shit, you usually get 10000+ views.,
,
Also, each stream you make, post it at various frontpage websites, not just gosugamers, put it in fucking nadota and dotacash, dotacommantaries, and even random pubs in dc will be watching and learning shit. try putting it on playdota, like speak with the staff and shit they might put it

							Can anyone give me a serious explanation to why anyone would use a wired mouse over wireless? There is no difference in lag time between the two now so I really see no advantage to putting up with the pain in the ass a cord provides
						"

							idk i had to use wireless with logitech, i didnt really like it. the dpis went up by incremenets of 250. idk if thats a wireless thing? i mean with a bungee it feels wireless tbh.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,the battery cant shut down mid match
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							it's really unnecessary, just tape your wire on the table
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Damn, you guys must be poor af. Mouse bungees are like $10 and it keeps the cord up high so there's no friction. ,
,
Also I use wired everything, including ethernet cables...
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							lol no friction,
,
In dota you play with relatively high sensitivity compared to games like CSGO where the mouse wires actually get in the way of things since you're constantly moving your mouse across a large portion of your mousepad. Maybe you should try taping your wire instead of justifying your $10 purchase.

						"

							Also a hard support player here. I got flamed super hard by a carry once, said I ruined lane equilibrium and gave their offlaner too much experience. I didn't argue and just took it because I thought maybe he had a point; I didn't know exactly what took place that could have been so bad. So I went into the replay for some 20/20 hindsight analysis. Found out I did nothing wrong, my rotations in and out of the lane to pull, stack and roam (getting our team's only kill for 10 minutes) were all as efficient as possible, but my carry ruined the equilibrium twice, first by pulling the enemy wave into my double pull, and second by bringing the creeps under the tower instead of tanking it for a couple of seconds waiting for the next wave to arrive (and he also missed almost all the last hits under tower). But nah, apparently on top of fixing all of the carry's mistakes, a solo support is expected to somehow simultaneously pull, zone a Clockwerk of all heroes, stop mid from losing, and prevent the Doom jungle freefarm.

						"

							,Ok, idra has 9k viewers and does a commercial every 10 min.  Do the math...even if he get half a cent, thats some pretty decent money.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Yeah but Idra has by far the most viewers of any stream as far as I can tell.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Yeah sure if you want to use idra as your primary example, he possibly makes between 100-300 off streaming per day but he does it for a living, the average joe however would make close to nothing.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
It's way less than a cent, but yea he makes a good amount.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i'm pretty sure jtv is 3cents and owned is 5 but i really don't know anything. Well yeah i'd do it probably like twice a week for a few hours. hon inhouse streams typically get anywhere from 200-500 viewers,
dangit....i just wanted some free money
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I'm pretty sure it's way less than that, otherwise i'd quit my job.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"

							i love your steams, you should do some t2 and t3 games from dotacash, i like to watch them on my tv while doing homework or playing shogun2 etc. Get your popular friends that people like to watch play to play more often and youll get views. Random pubs like me like to watch people like brood_star, mikey, vt, dsity, etc.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,No, it's not just his stream.  Pretty sure it includes youtube as well as vods.  Plus he does it more than any other streamer (12 hours a day, 7 days a week afaik), netting him a grand total of just over $10 / hr.  Still fucking good, but he worked for like a year to build up his numbers so it's not that surprising.

							Fun fact: You can usually tell a person's birth gender by his or her jawline. There are some subtle differences in the shapes of the skull between genders. Transgender people in the west aren't yet having extensive surgeries to alter their faces (afaik). ,
,
Don't believe me? Post some pictures of girls and I will tell you if they are hiding a little boneless beef downstairs. Face has to be fully visible.,

To start: All of Toysoldier's pictures were transgender.

							Trans people are mentally ill. SJW can get mad all they want, but it's true. Their suicide rate is 20x higher than non-transgender people because surgery doesn't fix the underlying issues that drove them to do the operation in the first place. ,
,
,
,
People should learn to deal with their mental issues by talking to a shrink or something instead of rushing off to an operation. Although it doesn't help that SJW and the media encourage and praise it.

							The debate is generally pointless, though, usually because of the motive behind it which is to try to dehumanize them. They are still people and are deserving of everything a non-transgender person deserves. I don't agree with their decision to have an operation, but it's their life and if it has even the smallest chance to make them happy, then power to them.,
,
But I do agree with Tralf that it shouldn't get so much exposure and glamour because there's really nothing special about it.

							,I've heard counters to the mentally ill/suicide points you made, these counters claim that trans people are driven to suicide so often because society belittles and refuses to accept them as who they are, and that ousting/bullying causes them to become depressed and suicidal. And that if everyone was more accepting, their suicide rates wouldn't be that much higher than the average Joe's. ,

Not sure if that's all true, but just putting it out there, it's probably a mix of the two IMO

Not as high as I expected it, but it's there. The other thing is (from what I understand) Chinese people care a lot more about relationships and usually judge a man by whether or not he's in a stable relationship with a woman. Seems like a pretty good environment to be a young lady in.

							good bump. Decided to watch some of this opt1kal ! I realize you have no viewers, but to keep viewers you should have a webcam (/perv) and try to talk. Unless you are really famous this is the best way to actually attract people which I assume is most streamer's goal. Some people don't care (ink) and just stream to try and attract girls so if that is you I'd recommend speaking or something. Anything.

						"

							I do talk to the viewers when I see em there. But honestly, no reason to talk when no one is listening. I do keep my chat open and the viewer list up constantly, so when I notice a new name in there I talk to em. Thing is, non of my friends play DotA 2, so I can't talk to people on skype or anything because they don't know what the hell I'm talking about...lol
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
haha yeah it's pretty hard to get started streaming unless you are known. You can go the faggot route and be obnoxious and sing pokemon and shit because I guess that never gets old to viewers and people love it. Honestly though streamers just do that because it attracts people and they know that. I love the pokemon theme song, but streamers take it as a marketing ploy. Anyways, if you are seriously  wanting viewers you got to post on reddit and all dota forums you know. This ego-centric forum won't give you anything. Make sure when you have viewers you interact and make them want to be there. gl ,

							Why the fuck do people want people to stream with a webcam? It means absolutely nothing. Only time i turn my cam on is when im taking shots to prove im not a pussy and to show my abs. Please dont ever say you get more viewers with a webcam
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,You get more viewers with a webcam. Being able to see people's reactions when they die, rage, or are really excited IS entertaining. What is more entertaining.. listening to someone on the radio.. or watching them speak on t.v.
						"

Globally, China is maybe the only Asian country with a high average IQ (could be highly inaccurate, though) despite a significant number of people living in poverty. Any other Asian showing has a strong GDP with a low poverty rate (South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan).

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							don't those asian countries just generally hold workers to higher standards liek expect them to get way more shit done than lazy americans?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							They might. Work ethic isn't the only factor in producing smart students, though.,
,
A lot of learning is done at home which becomes less likely in poorer households. Struggling parents are going to be less available to their children than well-off parents.  If a family is capable of living off of one parent's wage while another stays at home, that child is going to have the advantage of having a parent always available to learn with. And if a family is in a position to do that in the first place, it likely means both parents are well educated which is an obvious advantage to a learning child.,
,
A country like Finland produces some of the smartest students in the world without emphasising work ethic in the same way. It's just availability of good schools and how much parents or family can help the learning process. ,

I managed to broker a deal through some of my liasions in Shenzhen to get you you're own Chinese girl (supposedly with jade eyes too).

						"

							It depends, if the kill is clean, it's probably not worth it, but like if they spend half their regen and mana to get it and you come back full hp and mana into the lane with the free tp you just bought before dying it might be worth it.

							im using xsplit,

can u stream full screen or does it have to be windowed? If it's window only how do u prevent cursor from going off edge? I remember dl'n a program a long ass time ago but it's not compatible anymore i dont think.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Has to be windowed.,
,
Most games won't let your cursor go off the screen easily (usually have to hit escape/alt-tab or something).,
,
For Dota 2, use ""Windowed Fullscreen"" or whatever it's called. You should probably be using it already unless your comuter can't handle it (makes alt-tabbing super easy and you can still see what's going on in the game).,
,
You might be able to stream fullscreen with something like dxtory, but I'm not 100% sure.,
,
Also, in addition to XSplit, there are FFSplit and Open Broadcaster Software (OBS).
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							borderless window.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							You can hook it to game source or w/e and do it full screened if you own xsplit

,
*prolly reduced framerate, but why*,
,
i7-860,
8g ddr3,

,
apparently the problem consists when the program xsplit is operating, regardless of whether or not im streaming.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Is your processor the 2.8 Ghz one? That's below the minimum requirements if so. Most programs recommend at least 3.0 Ghz Quad-Core. You might be able to overclock yours (but check to see if your CPU is very overclockable). Could also be your upload rate getting maxed out, but sounds like that's less likely.,
,
You can try an alternative program, I've heard XSplit is naturally more intensive than others, but could also be a marketing ploy.
						"

ya it's the 2.8

this is a post depression self enlightenment i have witnessed countless times,
,
a golden boy prodigy grows up realizes his full potential will never be reached,
and sees there are countless others who have a better shot of reaching that next level (*cough*miracle*cough*),
,
youll see it with countless rappers etc all hyped up to the be the next big thing and then they fall off,
,
i remember when artour was an immature cocky shitstain ,
but i think the last ti humbled him  and hes lost his passion for this game,

some1 of artours caliber needs to reignite that spark if he ever intends to hold up the aegis of champions

every time i wake up, i have to reaffirm my height, look in the mirror to see if my eyes are still green and if my jaw is still looking solid as ever.,
when i converse with people outside my home, i make sure all of my speeches are consistently concise with a catchy lingo that is particular to my superior looks.,

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Yeah that's definitely the reason. I love statements that can never be disproven so instead you get to psychoanalyze the audience's reasons for accepting or rejecting them.,
,
,That should be even bigger motivation to deaf-mutes because none of those people listed should be employed in the scene yet somehow are.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							the person above me is truly an epic troll
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							she's bad, if she was hot i'd care less about her being bad. If she was good and still ugly i'd probably hate her more than if she was hot and bad. This is my truth as a man
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I mean how are 2 chicks that sound like they're Straight Outta Whiterun and a complete neophyte role models to anyone except as examples of people overcoming barriers solely because of some abstract meta-value? When retards say they're role models for other girls they're basically saying girls should look at them and realize they can succeed in spite of the community thinking they're untalented or even hating them - as long as they've got the right plumbing.,
,
As long as someone with a modicum of power is willing to pander to your demographic you can do anything (even if you shouldn't)!,
,
It didn't have to be this way. I'm fine with undeserving people being in the scene (since there are only about 2 or 3 people I can stand anyway) as long as they're not shoved in my face. Sheever and Soe could have sat out one fucking event the way every other personality except Merlini has. But no, now there's rampant misogyny in the casting/hosting scene.,
,
tl;dr - Don't call me a misogynist, I won't point out the fact that they suck at their jobs and should by all rights never be on my screen. The contract was broken in this case and not by me.

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							no1 flames Al Michaels for not playing football, and yet there he is commentating football, figure skating, everything. You can be good at casting something without actually playing it at a high level, you just need knowledge of it, of the players/people/coaches etc
						"

							Tobi and Ayesee have the same problem: they rely too heavily on a co-caster to keep their ape-like Dota analysis in check. They're great when they're doing something like TI and they have a legit co-caster. But if they're doing D2L or The Defense or some shit and they're alone (or their co-caster is off in his own world, rambling incessantly like a lunatic about how Juggernaut needs first-item Blink Dagger) then amateur hour starts up. Then they become insufferable, say wrong ass shit, and miss things on screen. Still better than GoDz who literally casts wearing only a blindfold and a smug grin.

,
plz help i am trash garbage shit sf
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Definitely a lvl1 Raze matchup
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yea just try to pull single creeps on ur highground and raze the low ground ones.

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							making ta get double wave(2 range creep) seems a good way of dominating the lane, but im not sure
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ta has no kill potential until lvl 6, i think u just start branches and raze ur way to a bottle, and spam waves from there. she cant stop ur farm or kill you until 6 and then you just get a tp and jungle.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							dont be a pussy
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							wraith band 2 branch,
,
dont skill ,
,
if u see u can get a soul guaranteed or something good creep aggro i guess then get souls,
,
otehrwise get raze,
,
if u wnan be a bitch get ult at 6 ta can nevr kill u
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i just right click him the fuck down with wraith brand double branch and necromastery and hope he fucks up the first wave
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							not anymore you dont you non dota player
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							well you gain damage by acquiring souls,
,
that's quite simple
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							you're going to just have to first pick sf/ta and get counter picked to learn these match ups.  You won't get anything from any forum you will be able to apply in a game.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,TA with a wraith band and lvl 1 psi blades can take sf below 200 hp on the first wave.. I've killed some.. TA goes full aggro if the SF has no help the lane is lost.  If your SF is counter picked that hard someone should chill with him for a wave or two so he can get the souls up.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							anything is possible with a small sample size
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yea, but he is just learning this match up against counter pickers if I am understanding this right.  If I or a TA has everyone showing on minimap I'll push right into that SF and be 2 quick.  ,
,
I need to confirm but I am 9999.9% positive a trip raze on ta + 2 auto attacks wont bring her down with a wraith band and two branches.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							It's definitely a situation OP (sf) where you can practice abusing aggro.  Right click the TA outside of 500 radius of creeps then instantly click him.  Back up repeat.  Mastering this will lead you to winning lane vs most people to xxxxk
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Keep tabbing out of games and seeing this over and over hah.,
,
What the above people are saying is:,
,
Go x2 branch, rush bottle, stay the fuck back and farm with raze.,
,
What I am saying and I believe dan is to learn how to beat that scrub ta
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							im almost certain this is 55/45 match up for sf
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							As soon as Ta hit 6, you either ferry ur self a set of sentries or get a support to buy you some, you put 1 down and kill his traps. ,
,
Now Ta can never solo kill you unless he has a haste rune. ,
,
That is untill he gets a dagger and Deso at 15min then ur fucked. xD

							Put a sentry on your high ground so she cant double/tripple slow you.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,how does this work though? i think any competent TA will just give  a right click, go back and sf would probably cancel his ult...

							Here it is: ,
,
As soon as the game hits the loading screen, type ""disconnect"" in console.  Sit and wait out the time remaining, you will never get a cooldown - also, since it's reborn and you can't report people in the loading screen, you will never get reported and you can keep doing it literally forever without any matchmaking cooldowns.  To see who's in your game, type shift+tab and ""View Players"".  You won't know who's on what team (unless there's a streamer), but you'll have a good idea as to how you do or don't want to play with.  Cheers!

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I mean meepo is always gonna be ""broken"" against low skill players when played by someone decent,
,
it's the nature of a hero with 1) split push 2) farm fast 3) solo kill potential 4) can solo rosh,
,
huskar is completely different. regardless of the skill level huskar always has the potential to just become an unkillable frontliner that breaks base with an aegis at 20-25 minutes, and without the right heroes you just can't really do anything about it unless you aggroed into the huskar or abused his weak laning phase.

						"

							also valve itself mentioned that they wanted to make the 6.85 patch after the ESL major, which would be actually really close to 6.85, which means now they want to realize patches in a fast pace, maybe each major there will be a balance patch it would make sense because those tournaments are bigger than summit,starlader etc
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							how would u nerf him?,

would u just nerf his numbers to hurt his laningor would u put some sort of leash on his fire spirit so it doesnt work if u are too far away or a small cast animation on his escape

						"

Yeah it's a top tier hero, but if you just nerf and nerf the instant something's good without thinking you create other issues. There's still (decent) heroes that are good against him (Huskar, Bone fletcher, Drow, Jugg, PA, Doom, DK, Invoker)

						"

at BEST he'll get an extremely minor nerf if there are enough reddit posts about it that won't actually affect him in the big picture

						"

							,Lol, what are these suggestions? I'm sorry if you played enough Dota, you'd know that half of these heroes don't do enough to easily play around Ember Spirit.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							the real question is can u click on dire rax yet
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							pretty surprising that ember didnt get nerfed at all in 6.85. he had a really strong showing at TI. usually those heroes get some kind of nerf. hopefully he'll receive some nerfs in 6.86 or the game changes in a way so he isnt as strong

							Tried to click diffusal on a hero. Didn't work. Tried several more times over the course of the game. Didn't work. Took my hands off the kb/mouse and tried to let Allah take control.

						"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ember spirit is like antimage forces u to play a different way or draft specifically against him or suffer the consequences, almost like huskar except huskar sucks fucking ass while ember and antimage can still ROFLMAO
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I think it's pretty clear that releasing Reborn and nixing the old client is another one of Valve's involuntary psychological tests. The only question is what malicious purpose they intend to use the data for.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							how about we stop being so hung up over dota and accept these online games have a natural lifespan. if the developer wants to take the game to a new direction, then more power to him. if you dont like it, stop playing.,

							i think having heroes like ember in the game really, really devalues heroes like sven, ck, and others with long cast/long travel time stuns and it just skews picks in a certain direction.  i don't really care that much but it just feels like valve doens't understand how valuable having 0 animation is.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							there are other instant cast powerful abilities but doing damage while invulnerable is always going to be incredibly powerful. combine that with a low cooldown on a simple easy to use spell and yea balancing a hero with that is going to be a challenge. i hate the hero personally but he's not impossible to adapt to and is still vulnerable in the laning stage.

						"

							go kill urself mg
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							he really doesn't.  his ""weaknesses"" are the only heroes who can catch him out.  bat, nyx, blink+hex, etc.  everyone is ""weak"" against those heroes, in that they can catch you out before you can react.  it just happens that that's the only way you can catch ember out.,
,
there's a lot wrong with ember.  a hero that good at split pushing shouldn't be that good at fighting early game.  antimage can't fight early.  furion does fuck all in team fights, his helpfulness comes from the items he buys.  tinker has huge drawbacks and basically has to farm for the first 25 minutes of the game.  ember is extremely strong early game and can solo support heroes (+some cores) from 900 away without taking damage.,
,
and the thing people are going to realize is that there's no need to build without any armor or attackspeed. you can go maelstrom skadi ac mjolnir or some shit and it works fine.  you can fucking attack in sleight, attack speed is not bad on the hero just because there are builds that don't go that route.

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							you're going to see everyone who was previously spamming storm to inflate their mmr move onto ember in the next couple weeks.  it's fairly retard proof.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							havent played dota for some time, isnt clinkz good now ? he was good before the patch and got buffed i think ?,
also isnt morph good now, didnt it and the items he gets get buffed?,
,
ive thought ember has been broken for a long time,i told rtz about it in some stream chat before ti i think mikes one and and ask him why didnt he played it since it was hes type of hero mid laner with bottle and huge carry potential he said the hero was mega trash and had lot of weaknesses didnt ask him what they were cause i didnt want to annoy him
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ember isn't retard proof at all,  I don't think you have the slightest clue of what a broken hero really is in dota kzz.,
,
maybe you should take some time away from playing ur earthshaker and play other heros, youll eventually figure things out
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Ember has been the most overrated hero in Dota since before 6.81. There was a period when western Dota forgot he existed, and like post-hp nerf Alchemist only the Chinese scene clung fanatically to him as a legit pick. Alas, he lets selfish mid players feel like gods with the ability to go deathless even when their team loses miserably so he'll never truly go away despite being unchanged for a year and a half.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							what if you just deathball against him at like 15 minutes
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							just execute this specific not generally good 5 man strategy to counter one hero
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I can see how ember might be good in pro dota but man, even the 5k embers in my games usually suck dick. I get the rare ember spammer with like 300 games on the hero who rape but I don't think you can compare that shit to leshrac or 6.83 sniper or any of the other retard heroes. If you make it to a point where you're raping pubs with ember honestly you probably deserve the mmr.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,let's do a test.  if you have over 50% win on embe rit's retard proof,
,
,
,
wow.  68%.  yeah, it's retard proof.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,it never starts like that, but as people play it more and more and get better and better and realize how broken it is (45 second remnant duration...30 second recharge Lol) then it's going to become just as bad as previous broken heroes.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							the hero is obviously very good but i still think if you can just even slightly coordinate with your teammates than taking down an ember isn't very hard. if you lack the heroes to do so, then i think you can just blame it on the team compositions. I know what you mean when you say he's a very high dmg+ high mobility hero, but I still think he's really easy to kill because his armor and stats are bad, players tend to not build items on that hero which rectify that issue either, and he's really susceptible to dying after like 2 disables, max. even in the ultra late game. i just think you need heroes and proper itemization to deal with it, something that may not be possible in pubs all that often. im just glad there isn't a hero like huskar anymore where you NEED 1-2 direct huskar counters to even have a chance of winning against it.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							He only needs 1/2 defensive items late game cause he can play in the back late game sleighting when its off cd and zipping to a remnant if the enemy jumps past his whole team to get to him. At least storm has to get on top of people to be effective in fights. ,
,
Reduce the dps of flameguard but keep the shield where it is so he's less insane at running you down 1v1 - but I doubt he's broken outside of pubs
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i feel like any argument i could put forward for ember being broken is totalyl dwarfed by the fact that blackmarines has 68% win on ember.,
,
68%.  blackmarines.  enough fucking said.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							at least he has like 1 starting armor. too bad PMS and Aquila are things. ,
,
i think spectre is gonna fall off soon in this meta. seems like one of those early patch heroes that fades away. not sure tho, but getting radiance is still a task and i think teams can easily play around that and abuse it.,
,
ember you just can't shut down ever... if he loses lane some how, you just go into any jungle and you can still farm. idk how anyone is arguing ember isn't 100% broke now that storm isn't relevant. ,
,
you cant even pick doom vs ember. he just gets a linkens and ults away instantly or he just gets away because of the cast time on doom lmao.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							still undecided about whether or not this hero is broken or just really good in the right hands,
,
maybe i've just seen too many really bad players butcher it
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Yeah I don't think Spectre is actually going to get nerfed
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							EZ 4 MARINES
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I feel like if they make his ult cool down/duration scale instead of the damage then he would be a lot better.  Right now people put points in stats over more levels in ult
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							spectre is fucking easy to deal with,
,
undying or doom +1 and her game is over unless the other lanes self destruct,
,
really beating spectre is just about avoiding dumb ass fights/overextensions that give her the assist gold she needs to comeback into a game after getting shit on in lane

,
(comeback mechanics that punished early/mid game heroes),
,
fast forward to 6.84 and the 5 man gravy train,
,
he thrives off fighting every 2 minutes thanks to the retarded changes to gold mechanics. now all the player needs to do is buy a BoTs and TP whenever a fight occurs; one kill gives him more gold than farming 2 creep waves, he has free fountain trips, etc. ,
,
tl;dr just fix the shitty gold system

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I don't think ember is broken. He takes skill to win with, you need to be decent to master sleight/chains, require good map awareness, and need to manage your spells very well to get the most out of them otherwise you're going to be super underwhelming.,
,
Once he gets his BF/daedalus/manta, things get pretty stupid, but the same could be said with AM.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I don't play ember so forgive me if I am wrong but don't you need to snowball on this hero or you fucking suck later cause it farms slow as shit until u get a bfury. ',

Are people picking viper yet
						"

Couple useful things to know:,
,
dota_disable_rangefinder 0 is now dota_enable_range_finder ""1"",
dota_quit_immediate ""1"" no prompt to quit Dota 2,
,
,
i think you can put all ur shit in dota 2 beta/cfg/config.cfg now. theres also a lot more stuff that's obvious in the default config.cfg that you can mess with that strictly required console, launch options or an autoexec in the past. this config is a lot better than dealing with autoexec crap, thats all i know
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yeah all i'm gonna say is there's tons of broken ass shit u can do with scripts ,
,
especially on heroes like tinker, you could probably eliminate half your key presses.  i don't care enough to fuck around with that shit more than i already have though.  too much effort.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if you use scripts to optimize spell interactions ur a Faggot
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i dont see what giood the rangefinder does.  i had it on in the past and it seems useless to me
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							FUCKFUCKFUVKUVK
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yeah that shit is real unrespectable and people should be banned for shit like that
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,i know what you mean but they aren't worthwhile, those scirpts involve binding multiple items/skills toa  key so you can rocket sheep etc all at same time but they are really situational
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i think if u use your brain u could make 3-4 scripts on tinker that make it easier to play and even for good tinker players would make at least some positive difference.,
,
i don't feel strongly about this shit.  i think it shouldn't exist, but it does and valve seems to be okay with it.  a lot of people and most pros have been using a script to move camera to rune spots for a long time now and i dont really see any important difference between that and binding two items to one key for example.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							they really aren't useful because you have to now dedicate another spot on your keyboard to something you will only use for one hero and if you misclick you could end up using sheep > dagon > rocket (miss) > laser beam on a creep,
,
and how do youi know if you really wanted to cast all of those, you cant change it on the fly. you might need to save mana for another hero that isnt there so you dont want to cast dagon just sheep + rocket, so its bad
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I used a script for techies that would autobuy sages mask, 2x clairty, and SR recipe  and tp scroll, so i could get to the lane as fast as possible to lay mines. it was really nice but with new techies its now lamer since techies sucks dick, and its more efficient i think to just mine a hard camp or ancients for insta level 2,
,
an AHK script could be good for rune sniping, if youre trying to take rune and an invis hero is there or if youre the invis riki etc, it will right click 10000000000 times per sec on that spot,
,
i had a script that let you instabuy rosh items in case I wanted to do a rosh strat with my team, it would help get it underway asap
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							also why the fuck aren't heroes always underneath runes? like im trying to fucking pick upa  rune and I cant cuz the enemy hero is fucking inside of it. the rune should have higher right click priority
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,there aren't that many hotkeys for dota.  adding another 4 isn't a problem for most people (or shouldn't be).  it just takes some getting used to.  ,
,
you have to make the scripts intelligently.  and you can't unbind the normal spell/item keys, obviously.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,you could always put shit in config.cfg but it's not good practice because the game writes changes you make in options to that file and it can mess shit up
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

							This is a great thread. I never knew you could combine multi-key presses into a single key stroke.,
,
I thought that valve bans macros? So if that's not the case, I would imagine all of the pros use these kind of config files?,
,
Or am I mistaken, is this stuff not allowed in professional games?,
,
Yea, this would be great with tinker... after you tp, you chain in blink, march, rearm to one key... blink, march, missile, rearm to another ,etc... You could use your groups 2-5 for that since you're not controlling multiple units, unless you're going to go necrobook or something... Also, alt-keypress would work (I don't use alt-keypresses for items anyway...),
,
If you could load different config files during hero select that would be legit. All you have to do is save it as an autoexe.tinker and rename it to autoexec, correct? So after you pick your hero, just restart dota 2 after you rename the autoexec.cfg file of your choice,,, so you could run a general autoexec.cfg for most heroes then customize for the ones that require specific micro moves or fast casters, etc... Great shit. ,
,
Also, this would do wonders with invoker, the number of times I've accidentally invoked the wrong spell during a fight, if I could just chain it to a single button so q tornado, w meteor, e sunstrike, etc... autoexec.quaswex autoexec.extortquas ,
,
Oh boy, this is gonna be a lot of fun to try.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,What is your reason for double binding commands to keys? ,
,
i.e. bind ""x"" ""dota_item_execute 0;dota_item_execute 0""
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Scripting has always been possible with the Source engine. Everyone had a separate class config for every class in TF2. I'm not sure if you can do this in Dota (auto-load a config when you pick a hero), but I think it would be very easy to do through console. You would just write a script under ""alias tinker_cfg"" and exec the alias through the console. I've always wondered why more people weren't doing this sort of thing. I guess the game (Dota2) is still fairly young.,
,
The double bind is a single-press armlet toggle or self-cast (for euls/linkens/lotus).,
,
Scripting complex actions (or even simple actions like armlet) is pretty bs in this game and Valve should probably do something to avoid a situation where every invoker player above 3k is casting each of his spells in a single button press.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I see, what's the difference then between the double bind and adding a + sign to the following action? ,
,
bind ""x"" ""dota_item_execute 0;dota_item_execute 0"",
,
vs ,
,
bind ""g"" ""dota_item_execute 4;+dota_ability_execute 5;"",
,
Gotta catch some sleep before I head to work, but this is going to be a fun project for this weekend if I find the time. Lulz will ensue with meepo. blink, select group 2, poof, tab, poof, tab, poof, tab, poof, tab, poof... LOL. All i need to do is land the net EZPZ.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							But yea, I always wondered how the pros have such insane reaction time and chain their actions so well, if they're using these type of config files then it makes so much sense now. utilizing this if you're not already doing so should easily add at least another 500 MMR to your ranking IMO because your efficiency will skyrocket.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I haven't looked into it much in Dota 2, but in TF2 +/- is used generally to simulate button press. For example:,
,
bind ""w"" ""+forward"",
,
has an implied secondary action wherein the release of 'w' issues a ""-forward"" command (essentially, release w to stop moving forward). Sometimes we explicitly bind the + and - action because it's needed for a certain situation.,
,
I'm not sure what it's being used for in Dota. My guess is that in that specific command it was just blindly copy-pasted by someone who didn't really know what he was writing. Maybe it's necessary when the command is an ability.,
,
The really interesting thing about that line is that it's not actually an armlet toggle action. It's executing an item and a hero ability on the same keypress.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Hmm, doesn't seem to be working for me in testing,
,
I'm trying this key:,
,
bind ""2"" ""dota_item_execute 1; dota_ability_execute 2"" ,
,
(In this case I'm attempting to cast blink at a target location and have it followed up with march, but it's selecting to cast march first. After the march has been cast, then I'm able to press the bind again to blink to the location),
,
also trying it with the + sign on the second command, still issuing only the second command.,
,
KZZ, care to add any input?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Jesus
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Ok, tested this with invoker, works like a charm,
,
,I'm having difficulty creating the appropriate keys to shift queue tinker blinking into the bushes and casting march instantly, the best I've gotten is a dinky result where you create 2 alias of +/- where +blinkmarch executes blink, and -blinkmarch then executes march, so you need to hold down your bind and shift while you click where you want to go, followed by releasing the bind and clicking again to cast march. ,
,
Anyone have any better suggestions on how to execute this?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							this threads been stov'd
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Oh man those invoker scripts. ,
,
No idea how to include the shift queue into a keybind. You're probably just going to need manual blink into match + rearm
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							u cant bind more than 1 ability/item that requires a mouse click to trigger at the same time.  so u cant do laser+march or blink+march.  if you try, it'll just cast the last command...unless that's on cooldown and then it'll go to the next to last command and so on.,
,
double casting an item is for three things:,
,
1. it's self cast for eul's/force, which is actually a fairly big deal.  one button self cast is really good, u already see a lot of pros moving away from double click self cast cause it's noticeably slower than just clicking on urself and one button selfcast is even better than that.  does require more binds tho...,
,
2. blinking back to well with 1 key press.  also really nice, noticeably faster than double key press to blink backward,
,
3. armlet toggle macro.  self explanatory.,
,
the other script i have bound to g is just for blademail+duel on lc.  you can do this in one keypress which is  pretty insane.,
,
these scripts were just the result of me messing around in practice mode.  i'm not used to them and i forget to use them most of the time although i believe they are definitely worth using if u can get used to them.  i think valve should remove all this shit but i don't really care and neither do they (clearly).,
,
im not playing dota for at least 3 months so yea this shit helps pass the time
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ive heard from players who went to ti that valve doesn't care about/check autoexecs that people put on flash drives.,
,
i mean it's kinda dumb if they said ""u can use this in online tournaments and rmm but not on lan.""  if that's their stance, it shouldn't be usable anywhere.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Right, duel blademail makes a lot of sense. The person in the thread earlier who said it was being used to blink and cast ES ulti threw me off, because based on that bind, you're going to cast echo where you're standing and not target blink. ,
,
Have you ever considered creating a custom lc.cfg file and running it whenever you pick LC so that your ult key automatically is binded to the item slot? This way you don't have to remember to use a different key, it will occur naturally. ,
,
Same with a pudge script that autocasts rot whenever you dismember, although the problem is that it will cast rot even as you're targeting dismember.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							in s1 dota i think you wouldve been able to do a blink echo with sixense_left_click which lets you bind left clicking to stuff but that's gone in reborn with no replacement
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Yea, that's dumb, they took all of the sixense commands when reborn was released.... I don't get what the point is of doing that. If you're going to allow scripting then allow all of it, none of this stupid half-assed shit where you can take some shortcuts but not others... either remove it all together or keep everything. I hope they release it back into reborn soon, but it's already been 4+ months since the change, seems pretty intentional.,
,
What's the stance on doing stuff like changing your remapkey.exe on a windows machine or loading a 3rd party program like autohotkey/autoit? That kind of stuff won't get you vacbanned, but do people consider it cheating in a tournament?,
,
I used to use autohotkey in wc3, twas good but never bothered to remake my scripts.
						"

							I say this like i'm ever going to play in a tournament LOL. I'll just set up my autohotkey... fuck it.

so far nothings good enough to beat it although some heros like zeus annoy it a bit
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							u guys r all real innovative with ur abadon builds.  im sure noones ever thought of building items like vlads, drums, or sny on him until u guys and logonbupt discovered it.
						"

i think people go the wrong skillbuild and generally are just incompetent ,

some people don't max the heal which is easily his best ability (it's like 12 second CD, dispel stuns, 300 health for 110 mana or something absurd)

As the only one in ranked, I'm here to tell you I fought an abaddon to the death for at least 20 seconds and he was very unhappy with the outcome.
						"

							Almost all the carries can win abaddon 1v1 easily in late game. But adaddon just did more for team.,

,
,
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							what inspires u to play loa and omniknight every game
						"

							I am just hoping that Pro team could also consider those heros as offlaner in their ban/pick so dota2 can be more diversified.  ,

						"

							,no,
,
u dont need to choke jungle and it slows u down cuase u get less procs on the passive.,
,
the most u might need to do is ferry some regen, you should be able to pretty much jungle 100% of the time easily with a quelling blade + stout (u need both)
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Chokepoint jungles slower but safer ya,
,
, these ones too L o l xP xD ,
,
Every doom i get is some dumbass 9 minute midas 16 minute lothars retard ricer thats 0/0/0 and every time theres one on the other team hes camping me as soon as he gets 6 and its fucking annoying and im just awful at dota
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yea press the attack is like a better abaddon shield, she can help out the lane a lot sooner than like a doom or something
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							my offlane doom is highly successful I just go arcanes mek shivas and spam ping towers every time I got doom and I don't think I've lost yet
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							not to mention if ur opponents are bad u can easily kill the enemy laners at 6
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i'd only do that as radiant,
,
i believe it pwns tho,
,
if u get a regen creep in the big spawn i think u autowin the lane

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,most people don't have the faintest idea how to really play it
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ya I usually just do it on radiant but sometime u can get away with it on dire if the other teams supports are bad and just let u wander around in their jungle
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,ember is terrible mid unless its melee vs melee
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							well radiant offlane is fucking paradise compared to dire offlane anyway,
,
80% of the time u can get at least one creep pull to the big camp which is usually lane won
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							well i beat a qop mid with ember maybe she was just bad...
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							it really is. I'm so much more willing to play offlane on radiant if people on my team want both mid and safelane than I am on dire.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,rapes sf i can tell youi that much
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							it's a 1 armor melee hero with a shitty fucking animation and medium dmg it doesnt rape sf
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							lc jungle at its luckiest can get a 7min blink and thats scary as fuck cause no mid laner should expect that shit in a pub r0fl
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							and if sf goes thru ember's shield isnt ember screwed r0fl
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							pretty sure randoming has some sort of psychological advantage for the other people in the game
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							and if he facetanks the spell dmg w/ his own hp then uses shield as dps hes not gonna win the fight unless sf is at some disadvantage
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i mean i've beat sf, qop, puck, and ta 1v1 with earthshaker but im not dumb enough to think that means that i will win vs those heroes if they're being played by semi competent players
						"

							alright u caught me smithe the lupin the third i actually never faced the matchup but i usually loathe shadowfiend players going mid cause they're as trashy as pudge and invokers to me when it comes to pubs

3. are u so fucking un self aware that u don't even consider that maybe, just maybe, just fucking maybe u don't know all that much about this game and that's why u have sub 50% win?
						"

							1)	I don’t care,
2)	I never said he beats everything mid, I’m saying the hero is fucking bullshit but you take everything literally. ,
3)	I have a sub 50% winrate cause I play with my 2-3k rated flatmates who think witch dr + riki is the strongest lane in the game under any situation.,

						"

						"

							,i like it for the safelane as a harass when my support leaves to do godly things but i think having 2-3 points of flameguard is far more safe/consistent,
,
think its a waste if u dont sof and chains cause maxing sof for the dmg alone w/o taking advantage of the fact u can constantly be in range to disable/setup a gank every 10 seconds is apart of the deal

 ,
In terms of early game try avoid lanes with high range harass (e.g WR) and avoid that gay spikey cunt BB at all cost, he just destroys you. The shield is super strong and he decimates support heroes with low MS e.g CM. He is an ok mid hero, but I feel like he should really be laning.,
 ,
Try avoid full on team fights until you at least get one level in fist. The point is that you can cast your shackle from range by casting during the slashes. This does take practice but it’s by far the most effective way to hit multiple shackles safely. ,
,
Level 6 is where this hero gets bullshit, all you need to do is carry TP. Whenever your low on hp or mana, just chuck out a spirit by your tower or in the trees (at no mana cost) TP home heal up, then BOOM your straight back in lane instantly. Later in the game this becomes even more bullshit as you can split push lanes, chuck spirits in the tree’s and just wait for someone to come for you. Think of it like Morphlings replicate without the stupid animation when you cast relocate.,
 ,
In terms of items, Phase Boots is by far the most effective. Bottle is also core 100% of the time regardless if you’re mid or not, as I said above you will be taking those free trips to base via his ulti so take advantage of the free refill. This hero is mana intensive early game. Drums is OK, all though sometimes just the standard bracer will do. Battle Fury I’m on the edge about, I think in situations where if you’re farming fast from the get go or if the enemy team has a cluster fuck team fight it’s a good choice. Majority of the times a deso rush is more effective for damage output. Crits is mandatory and BKB is situational but in most cases you should get it. Your last 2 items should usually consist of Heart / AC / divines / More Crits.,
 ,
Skadi, Mljnr, Vlds, Sny etc (whatever valves tells you to buy)is the worst shit on this hero, especially Mjnr, Deso is always the better choice.,
 ,
Also if you’re playing this hero with friends, try get one of them to play magnus so you can enjoy one button ultra-kills. ,
,
Pro-Tip fist dodges stuns including the likes of storm bolt. This hero also hard counters the fuck out of broodmother and necro units.

,
So not surprising Loda gets mad and decides to kick his ass, though so he prob shoves him and then gets his ass wooped and strangled lmao. Then saves face saying he was attacked lol.....,

							Dirty Joe's Taco Shacka day ago,
This is all false. Valve wants to fuck you over and make you lose by giving you shitty teammates every match. If Dota was a good game, it would have the option of letting you buy MMR and buy the right to have good teammates.,

Teammates are worse than enemies, because Dota is a single player game, and all other players but you are AIs.

My schooling followed the pattern my colleague Elizabeth Minnich has pointed out: whites are taught to think of their lives as morally neutral, normative, and average, and also ideal, so that when we work to benefit others, this is seen as work that will allow them to be more like us.

							I was advised to be silent but I can't stand it anymore. @, strangled @, and I was the one who with force stopped Richard so he wouldn't deeply injure Loda, or worse. I don't know what would have happened if I wasn't there. ,
,
I came down and saw Richard and Kelly having a huge verbal dispute. I took the position between the two and when Kelly walked off I tried to calm Richard down and advised him to let this go as it wasn't worth it. ,
,
While talking to Richard, Loda pops up without me really being able to react. Loda didn't touch Lewis but aggressively approached Richard. There was a fast and aggressive conversation where Loda said ""I'm here, yes it's me"". Suddenly Richard attacked Loda and started to strangle him.,
,
Who strangles another when threatened? That's beyond me! It wasn't like Richard tried to push Loda away and accidentally hit his throat. No, Richard grabbed Lodas throat with both hands and pushed him backwards towards the ground while strangling what to me looked very hard.,
,
I grabbed Richard and pulled him through the door. I was upset and sad that he had fucked up the situation so badly as I had tried to calm him down. This story was given as a witness to the police on site. ,
,
Later on DreamHack staff was able to get both parties to agree to settle this and move on. Loda wanted a guarantee that Richard wouldn't spin this online which they both eventually agreed on. ,
,
Since then Richard have according to me, spinned this as much as he can in all direction to try to become the victim and to bait people like me to overstep and react. ,
,
Here is the truth from someone who witnessed this from a 1 meter distance and had to act with civil courage and wanted to settle this to move on without this being a public circus and popularity contest.

i've seen him do it like 3 times. when it happens we call him ""stranglies"" and have to physically restrain him. i would not be the least bit surprised if he kills someone at some point in his life.

							Is it a European thing to announce to the world your intention to confront somebody then act surprised when it comes to blows?

							,yeah one time during a really drunken poker match his younger brother was antagonizing him like crazy and mr.stranglies came out and he flipped the table and dove at his brothers jugular. nigga's eyes were straight black. i honestly believe if i wouldnt have been there to intervene he coulda straight strangled the life out of his brother. ,
,
also saw him do this to a complete stranger at a new years eve event. he was blacked out and his girlfriend claimed that some guy threw a piece of paper towel at here. he went into a rage and i guess he didnt properly see who she was pointing at cuz he dove at and strangled the wrong guy. ,

							KZZ opened his asshole and quietly whispered to Legit420, ""Do it."" Legit420 finished rubbing the lube on his 8"" dick and slowly stuck it inside KZZ's asshole. KZZ bit the pillow out of pain, the girth being too much for his tiny asshole. Legit420 kept shoving it in, until finally 4"" was covered. He slowly moved back and forth. KZZ started moaning lightly as they became one. Legit420 said ""I love you..."" KZZ replied, ""I love you too."" As Legit420 kept thrusting, KZZ felt amazing inside. He started to feel that he would cum. He started moaning louder and KZZ was starting to feel that he would come too. As they both moaned for each other, their lust and passion charged within KZZ and they both ejaculated at the same time. Legit420 pulled out and looked at KZZ. They engaged in a deep tongue kissing that would make them true lovers.

							[5:34:53 PM] Yan Gao: the sum of all natural numbers go up,
[5:34:59 PM] Yan Gao: as you approach infinity,
[5:35:03 PM] Yan Gao: so it's a divergent series,
[5:35:05 PM] jing: yeah u stupid dumb slut,
[5:35:08 PM] jing: hear that,
[5:35:10 PM] Yan Gao: and thus cannot converge on a number,
[5:35:20 PM] Brandon B: i thought if it converged then it had to be a convergent series.,
[5:35:23 PM] Brandon B: i wonder if theres any other examples,
[5:35:39 PM] Yan Gao: it's sum isn't -1/2 in any standard form of the usage of sum,
[5:35:55 PM] Yan Gao: the problem is that it doesnt converge,
[5:36:01 PM] Yan Gao: how can it approach any number as  you add more,
[5:36:02 PM] mason: well u used its wrong,
[5:36:06 PM] Yan Gao: it just gets bigger,
[5:36:14 PM] phrame: um,
[5:36:26 PM] phrame: well,
[5:36:32 PM] phrame: he's not wrong i think,
[5:37:06 PM] Yan Gao: i mean it probably is -1/2 in some random ass method of summation,
[5:37:36 PM] phrame: qUaNtUm SeRiS,
[5:37:50 PM] Brandon B: i mean im looking at the wiki article and i have no idea what the fuck this riemann zeta function shits saying but i imagine its smart or something.,

[5:41:42 PM] mason: i dont knwo anything aobut math,
[5:41:46 PM] mason: how do positive numbers,

[5:41:55 PM] mason: this is so over me lol...,

[5:42:17 PM] richard: ?,
[5:42:19 PM] richard: arent we all math majors here,
[5:42:21 PM] Brandon B: well once u accept 1-1+1-1... = 1/2 then u get the rest by proofs.,
[5:42:36 PM] phrame: isn't it just like,
[5:42:47 PM] Yan Gao: in a method that is used to represent the sum of an infinite series that doesn't converge on a number,
[5:42:56 PM] jing: because you dont know where you stop the summation,
[5:43:04 PM] jing: you're taking the average of all summations for that series,
[5:43:08 PM] Brandon B: no,
[5:43:09 PM] phrame: well,
[5:43:10 PM] phrame: no,
[5:43:11 PM] Brandon B: thats a real shite way,
[5:43:13 PM] phrame: it's not an average,
[5:43:18 PM] Brandon B: they use a more accurate proof in another video,
[5:43:23 PM] phrame: i mean,
[5:43:28 PM] jing: im watching that video,
[5:43:29 PM] phrame: there's a really intuitive proof,
[5:43:31 PM] jing: that's what they're saying,
[5:43:31 PM] phrame: u just,
[5:43:35 PM] Brandon B: ,
[5:43:36 PM] phrame: add the sequence to itself,
[5:43:50 PM] phrame: and notice how it cancels itself out,
[5:43:58 PM] phrame: except for a 1,
[5:44:05 PM] phrame: maybe that' jsut me,
[5:44:11 PM] Brandon B: yea,
[5:44:16 PM] phrame: what's this zeta shit tho.,
[5:44:16 PM] Brandon B: 1-s=s i think,
[5:44:21 PM] Brandon B: thats way above me.,
[5:44:22 PM] phrame: 2s = 1,
[5:44:22 PM] Brandon B: fuck if i know,
[5:44:30 PM] phrame: i like ur 1-s,
[5:44:32 PM] phrame: that' nicer,
[5:44:33 PM] Brandon B: apparently its the most rigorous way and it makes sense if u know riemann zeta,
[5:44:42 PM] phrame: i know catherine zeta,
[5:45:02 PM] Brandon B: all i know is terrence tao wrote a blog post on it and that guyys a genius and im not,
[5:45:28 PM] jing: i think,
[5:45:29 PM] richard: whos that,
[5:45:31 PM] richard: that guys no cong shu,
[5:45:33 PM] jing: they're doing it by,
[5:45:38 PM] Yan Gao: i mean isnt this shit all irrelevant,
[5:45:48 PM] Brandon B: it is,
[5:45:49 PM] jing: the way they are subtracting,
[5:45:50 PM] jing: S2,
[5:45:55 PM] Brandon B: im taking heat on nadota and u guys are talking about math,
[5:45:59 PM] Yan Gao: they're trying to get views with the whole sum of all natural numbers is -1/2 shit,
[5:46:00 PM] jing: is by subtracting 1 element from 1 element,
[5:46:02 PM] jing: individually,
[5:46:09 PM] jing: are you allowed to do that in a series,
[5:46:12 PM] Yan Gao: when people are referring to different kinds of sum,
[5:46:15 PM] Brandon B: well why not.,
[5:46:23 PM] jing: because then its not a sum,
[5:46:30 PM] jing: it's only a sum when you do the final summation,
[5:46:38 PM] Yan Gao: we're not dealing with actual sums here tho,
[5:46:44 PM] jing: the operation between the two series is not a summation,
[5:46:50 PM] jing: the operation they use anyway,
[5:46:56 PM] Brandon B: i dont think what ur saying matters.,
[5:47:12 PM] jing: he even says,
[5:47:14 PM] Yan Gao: the hwole thing is an attempt to give divergent series a sum,
[5:47:16 PM] jing: this isn't a physical infinity,
[5:47:22 PM] Yan Gao: because a divergent series cant have an actual sum,
[5:47:33 PM] jing: he literally says ""this isn't a physical infinity"",
[5:47:36 PM] jing: this can only exist on paper,
[5:47:38 PM] jing: as a concept,
[5:47:38 PM] Brandon B: well if ur gonna talk about semantics i dont think it actually approaches -1/12,
[5:47:46 PM] Brandon B: its just a quasi limit not an actual one,
[5:47:53 PM] jing: as soon as you put a stop to the series,
[5:47:58 PM] jing: the answer becomes infinity,
[5:47:58 PM] Yan Gao: it's just a different use of the term sum,
[5:48:01 PM] jing: instead of -1/12,
[5:48:08 PM] Brandon B: yea.,
[5:48:14 PM] Brandon B: i am in agreement with what is being saiad,
[5:49:07 PM] jing: what he did wasn't an equation,
[5:49:10 PM] jing: he's just changing the series,
[5:49:16 PM] Brandon B: now i am not in agreement with what is being said.,
[5:49:29 PM] jing: he's essentially cahging every element in the series,
[5:49:35 PM] Brandon B: whys that matter,
[5:49:40 PM] Brandon B: hes jsut manipulating the equation to yield a useful result,
[5:49:43 PM] Brandon B: the same is done in any mathematical proof,
[5:49:59 PM] Brandon B: theres a lot of times u add like +1-1 ranodmly,
[5:50:09 PM] Brandon B: then u can difference by squares things,
[5:50:31 PM] jing: what use does that have, you know the answer in any setting will not be -1/12,
[5:50:44 PM] jing: only in the abstract of an infinite series does that answer apply,
[5:50:55 PM] Brandon B: well it's used in quantum mechanics apparently.,
[5:51:06 PM] Yan Gao: in some number theory analysis or some random quantum mechanics thing i'd imagine,
[5:51:28 PM] Yan Gao: i need a goddam job that produces an actual product,
[5:51:31 PM] Yan Gao: that'll set me right,
[5:51:37 PM] Brandon B: i mean u can say the same for any limit,
[5:51:47 PM] Brandon B: any limit that approaches infinity and yields a result will have no use because it approaches infinity,
[5:51:54 PM] Brandon B: i think logarithms wouldnt exist fi u dismissed it then.,
[5:52:15 PM] Brandon B: id have to check my notes or whatever though ~_~,
[5:52:19 PM] jing: well would you use an algorithm,
[5:52:28 PM] jing: that said if you added all natural numbers it gave -1/12,
[5:53:00 PM] jing: how would you use it to do any operation if that's what you're expecting,
[5:53:05 PM] Brandon B: im seriously unsure what's being said here,
[5:53:12 PM] Brandon B: it's just a proof that apparently is very useful for physics,
[5:53:23 PM] Brandon B: i mean calculators give u answers like 1/0 = infinity or whatever,
[5:53:52 PM] jing: well off to read kzz x legit420 fanfics

							Hello everyone. Me and my friends have created a league for all western teams to come compete in a league that will take place on tuesdays, (you can reschedule matches of course). We just started this week and are looking for all skill levels of teams. We will be sorting the teams out based on their skill level so every match will be entertaining and competitive. The league will start Tuesday, March 10th or 17th, Depends on how many teams join. The format for the league is 8 teams per division. Top 4 advance to a playoff with the prize of items. (Season 2 will have a payout.) The bottom 4 teams will also go into a lower bracket playoffs and will play for items as well. If you have anymore questions please email us @ ,

If you're interested in signing up please go to our website! , !

							how come like in 60% of my games the carries on my team make the blatant decision to not come to teamfights, not help my team, and just kinda do their own thing
						"

							how does BEESA DO IT
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							HOW ,
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							maybe they need stability in their life.,
,
maybe they need to know that despite their parents divorcing. despite their lackluster marks in school, despite being excluded in their workplace, despite not knowing where tomorrow's meal will come from, despite a death in the family, despite the psychological instabilities they're born with and have developed along the way, despite the absence of hope and expectations that their futures will improve, despite it all that they will still be able to get 600 last hits in 50 minutes.,
,
by making the the match possible and by tolerating their inadequacies, you've brought a semblance of stability back to their lives. look into yourself and tell me you're not comforted by the thought
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							maybe they;re just dumb cunts

							,felony is one of those players where you know if u kill him once he'll ruin the game for his team so you're actually kinda happy to see him on the enemy team,

We raxed one lane and the puck had treads blink euls and 6.5k in the bank. In fact we were all rich after the team wipe + raxing them. a normal game would have ended about 5 minutes later when we raxed again. ,

Well the puck bought a rapier and walked straight in and died. It was picked up by the enemy Tiny, along with the 1400 gold from ending pucks beyond godlike spree. anyways the fucking game lasted another 38 minutes before we finally lost. And we never did get that rapier back from Tiny

I think I have a firm grasp on the basics (compared to high level play), but I want to get better and have a better understanding of items, proper timing, warding, ect. I've Q'd in very high a few times with friend and did fine, but they don't play that much anymore. So I basically just solo Q.,

I work mon-fri 130-10pm, so I usually just play dota or something since most people I know are asleep by then for work. So I figured I might as well try and get at a high level of playing in this game.

my dear closest fan kzz, I would like to thank you with all my heart for choosing me as your flame target, I really am glad that person like you, who dedicated his life to this amazing dota forum and have over 12k posts even have time to talk about shit players as myself. eventhough I dont like being associated with oxen, as I never pretended to be anyone, and always open for criticism, personal chats etc, unlike other people who ignore friendrequests and have closed steamwalls for comments. kzz you truly are the hero NAdota deserves, but not the one it needs right now. good luck on your future posts, and always feel free to contact me at steamcommunity.com/id/bishmar. ,

							Wehsing was known around school as the happy, sweet, friendly girl with good grades. Not only did she have a flawless reputation and personality, but she had looks to match. She was nearly perfect in everyone's eyes, including Jacky Mao's. Jacky was very much like every other teenage boy in high school. He played football, had friends, got along with almost everyone, and he even did things like forgetting his homework. Jacky and Wehsing never came into contact. They knew of each other and heard things that other people said, but never really cared to get to know each other. That was until a cold fall day when Jacky find Wehsing in the woods after school, planning to do something that could change everything forever. A friendship soon develops and through all of the tears, sorrow, and other emotions incorporated, something else is formed that neither of them can act on. Should Jacky give up on his feelings towards Wehsing, or should he give them a try?

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							the only solution to mm is using aanothe rmode besides all pick,
,
valve concurs cause they're adding a new mode i believe
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							is AP without heroes banned from CM such a bad idea,
,
that's all you really need I think
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i mean they could just do AP and each player gets one ban,
,
i bet that mode would be legit.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							RD
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I think one reason people hate CM is it takes so goddamn long to pick/ban.,
,
Valve could give like 10 seconds for everyone to ban one hero, then pick, w/ random ban if you don't ban a hero in the time limit. No reserve time bullshit, and a parallized banning process over 10 people should speed things along nicely.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Also the only thing I saw about a new mode was some shit on reddit about supercreeps coming in 6.81
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i bet random draft with a captain instead of retards picking their own shit and picking sniper would be legit,
,
or any of the shit thats been suggested,
,
as of now mming degrades the quality of life
						"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,in league i think they have a system in ranked where everyone picks in a CM order taking turns banning and picking their own heroes - I'd really like asystem like this
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							imagine a world where u can play an AP game with phoenix slark tb ember banned
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Basically a random person gets assigned blue/ pink and they get 3 bans each then they do the 1/2/2/2/2/1 pick phase which would be so legit but valves stupid or whatever
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ya i didnt know it exactly but id really like for that to be in MM ,
,
i hate the report system right now but itd be really cool if they added that system and had a separate report system for people who would just pick annoying shit - like  a non-support when theyre the last player picking and the nbanning them from playing that mode for a while
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"

							I had an earth shaker max enchant totem first earlier like who the fuck teaches these people how to play the game
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,cuz its too much effort to mute someone that is shit talking you case by case. now i see.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							as soon as someone shit talks you and you mute them the damage is already done. better to just not get tilted in the first place
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I just ignore flame completely. you just have to tune it out and realize you shouldn't get mad just because they're mad.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							don't mute someone just bc they flame you. everyone flames everyone. mute someone if they abuse the mic. ,
,
ignore flame, process important information like ""back"" ""push"" or ""stun""

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							my riki walked mid cuz we didnt finish rosh to his likings
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,It wasn't an ability draft game
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							lol.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							enchant's good but u clearly want aftershock first if ur going enchant build,
,
u can go enchant over fissure after afterhosck is maxed
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if u havent 1shot someone at level 6 solo mid maxing aftershock i feel sorry for you
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Solo mid enchant max before aftershock no mana boots blink dagger, hit people with your magic tree kills for days
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I thought the legit build was lothars and phase boots if u do that build
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Treads blink armlet bkb heart
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							phase boots are pretty bad i think.  enchant is base damage so treads will add more to enchant hits + tread swapping/mana/health/etc.  attack speed is nice (a ltitle anyway) because it lets you get your combo off with more space since u want to hit 1x after every stun
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I go blink into Daedalus because yolo
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i've gone daedalus and i think other shit is almost always better.  it's hilarious to see 2k crits but a random chance to get a crit when u have a pisspoor attack speed and 5 sec cd on enchant feels really bad,
,
better off going linken's heart or hex or something
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Yeah I mean I just do it because it's funny
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							In a close game I wouldn't get it until like 6th item and then only if I'm the only source of physical damage and I've got like an AC or something,
,
For like a ""real build"" hex or linkens for days
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							jesus i've been maxing fissure first up until now,
,
im way behind in the es metagame lmao
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Treads, bracer, blink, halberd is a great build to get a solid base of strength to increase ur enchant dps. ,
,
Keeping fissure level 1 seems like the way to go but I'm undecided on whether to go 1-4-1-1 or 1-1-4-1, or some variation
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							im convinced now that im getting the impression it's like maxing overload first on storm,
,
higher numbers or something
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Most people still max fissure first I don't think you're behind the meta or whatever,
,
Support ES probably wants to max fissure first mmost of the time for example
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							theres nothing wrong with maxing fissure first
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Max enchant early is shit without armlet to buffer. Aftershock should always be maxed first, following fissure. Will Nadota ever be meta?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							will you take us there?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I can't make threads, or post in strategy. Why waste my breath?,
,
Edit : nadota wouldn't know meta if it fucked their imaginary waifu

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							he's here,
,
i've summoned the meta
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,you have really serious mana issues if you max fissure first, like, cant tp and combo from max mana without arcs,
,
not saying its always wrong but you definitely at least want a stick and probably some branches and you really have to play around it
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if u got mana issues wit maxing fissure u just sux
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Let it be known that anyone who buys mana boots before blink is ayesee-tier
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							tube. or some shit ,
,
the most retarded player ive seen in awhile. and i mean like dumb piece of shit that needs to look at its own replays at least 1000 times and realize ""wow im a really bad bad player"".,
,
can you retards stop playing tinker mid..its so fucking overplayed now and the bad tinker players i see on a daily basis is just saddening.. ,
,
and i swear if u go dagon 5 on tinker right after blink when ur score is like 0-6-0 then ill slap u in the face

							Not to be confused with ""Michael I'll miss you"" who's incredibly high skill and good looking too
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							everyone with a sub50% winrate should automatically drop to 4k mmr or below. and anyone who has most played ember/lycan/slark/invoker/whatever hero is broken should be muted until they get a better hero distribution in their top8.

excuse me?
						"

						"

							RTZ  SUCKS UCB~ 999  this guys one of those 3 wraith band, straight into bots morph he trys to go mid everygame too hes like 5.5k or some shit so your gonna get him in your games good luck
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I searched the thread hoping I was awful to one of you in one of my matches, I'm disappointed.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,That build is from like 10 years ago
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							""Shiny"",
,
like the first player to make me legitimately angry in a dota game in a long time i can't even believe this person fucking exists
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							my wr's got a 34% winrate but I'm sure that's not on me, that hero just doesn't win games.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							wr is a candidate for worst hero in game material honestly
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							why is rank 1 shackle so ass, maybe if it scaled differently she'd be a decent support
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,i believe this is the same person as shinydota
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i kinda think wr pwns if u play her well idunno.,
,
i always felt like she'd be really legit in aggro trilanes either as support or carry.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							wr landing a 4 sec stun on two heroes is better than a 5sec arrow cause 1. arrow is usually far as fuck 2. its fuckign TWO HER0ES LOL
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							but yeha like kzz says hero is not for the weak heart
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i see why ppl thinks she sucks.  it's a little like potm in a way.  your contribution to a teamfight is fucking limited if the enemy team playes intelligently/you miss your shit.,
,
still 1.5 BAT on a 600 range hero is fucking insane
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if u guys arent going phase blink force for maximum fun ure dumb
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							5 second arrow also does 400 damage though. I think i'm just bad at turning wr games into a win, maybe you just go mek, looks like I went phase->force every game.,
,
if you miss shackle one fight your heroes a ranged creep for the rest of the engagement
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i think force is inferior as shit to blink and rtz and theeban do too
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if u chimps could stop trying to be rtz and building maelstrom on this hero that'd be much appreciated
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							whys mael bad seems fine to me u dont have to upgrade it and that + powershot makes her so fast at farming/pushing,
,
with blink and windrun shes really hard to kill as a split pusher too
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I yhink Force is good tho if you want survivablity
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							phase, blink, force, euls, sheep, refresher/linkens/skadi is the most fun ive ever had
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i think its inferior for setting up shackles and after blink mael you want bkb or possibly aghanims if you're really not afraid of spells anyways
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ya im sure 3 mobility items is fine and super fun but i dont think that makes mael ""bad""
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							im not saying saying mael is bad im saying pubs r just gonna try to be rtz and farm the whole map effectively taking away the resources from the real 1 role and losing them the game b/c theyre not rtz's
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							phase mek force is like the support build, maelstrom blink (orchid maybe?) is for core role id say
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							glad K poppers agree with me
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,460
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							WR mid is insanely strong. good BAT like kzz said, good dmg, makes good use of runes, great at ganking with levels, hard to kill, etc. her ult is so damn strong, u can manfight stupid carries who think they can rape u without an MKB. WR's biggest problem is that shackles tend to be hard to land at higher levels where people are positioning properly or just arent near something to be shackled to. her and potm used to be really really even in terms of style and role fulfillment, but she got outshined hard by arrow/ult buffs.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I don't know who godzhand is, but hes 5.6k, went phase boots force staff on mid bat and fed away the game after the other teams safelane antimage started 0-5,
,
,
ive lost all will to platy this game
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							godzhand is a play maker and a game winner. i don't think 1 bad game warrants being a ""worst player you can get in RMM"" so i think you're just being dramatic and a baby.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I agree that kid pwns
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							How are you meant to deal with people throwing right as the enemy are at your rax and you can quickly turn the game around with a solid teamfight, but one guy gets caught by a pudge hook or mirana arrow or osmething?,
Jumping in often isn't enough to save him in my experience; I'm asking because I've had a bunch of games thrown recently like this
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,You dont. You play your best and hope your dipshit teammates dont fuck it all up.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,thats my boy dont hate on danny
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							how come wr is worse than tinker ,
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i'd like to reiterate attackdruid, let's all hate on that disgusting fucking mouth breathing autistic idiot
						"

 roadto5k is a mic spammer and a bad carry but his mic sucks so you just hear weird background noise while he's yelling it's pretty funny if it wasn't so obnoxious
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Some fucking idiot seriously kept attacking the ranged creeps and melee creeps at intervals such that the tower would guaranteed kill it on the next attack as the fucking support and wouldn't stop.

							Mid please!
						"

goes drums->force->level his orbs evenly->do nothing the whole game, and apparently only plays invoker,

,
im just glad this is like the lowest mmr ive been in 3 months, ill probably go back up soon. u can tell all these shitters who lock 4 cores get upset when their supports actually buy wards and do things because they can't blame other people for dying next to the enemies with 4 heroes missing on the minimap

all he does is afk farm for 40 minutes and die b/c he doesn't carry tp's and by then 60 minutes in your team is in such a hole he can't 1v5 the team and you lose. i beat him when i play him and lose when im on his team

""I'll play the void"" said Mason, as he gargled down another Dr Pepper.,
“My voids beaten top players like Felony and oxen” he added.,
,
Universe looked uneasy. This was the kind of situation that caused Dignitas to fail at TI3. As he was about to speak, he was cut off.,
,
""I've been practicing the enigma ancients strat for this tournament. Its possible to get a 21 minute soul ring plus mek doing so."" said Zai.,
""Shut up euroshit, listen up. I need to pick a hero that can defend pushes as well as push at the same time. Any ideas?"" shouted PPD.,
,
“We can do some early aggression with enchantress, getting 2 towers before Vici hits level 6 on …” whispered Universe.,
“PICK RIKI” shouted Artour as he interrupted Saahil.,
Mason, PPD and Arteezy smiled with glee, as they started the traditional USA chants. Mason’s heart rate rose high enough that he was able to feel movement in his leg stumps. Mason let out a defiant roar, escaping the clutches of his wheelchair.,
,
“I’LL MURDER YOU ALL IRL” shouted Mason, as he stumbled and lost his breath.,
,
He lost his balance and collapsed over PPD just as PPD was about to pick Rikimaru, the Stealth Assassin. The mouse bounced onto Timbersaw as PPD clicked.,
,
The game started, and PPD’s natural talents kicked in.,
,
“Don’t cry for me, I’m already dead” moaned PPD, as he quoted Barney Gumble, a character of the American sitcom “The Simpsons”.,
,
The game flew its natural course and EG lost within 15 minutes. Universe, once again the leading farmer on team Evil Geniuses, was unable to salvage the game. After all, there is only so much you can do with a poor man’s QoP. Last year it was the roundest object on Earth (Sneyking’s head) that would be his undoing. This time, it was America.,
,
There would be no dunks. There would be no vacuum walls. There would be no clutch chronos. There would be no title for universe.,
,
See you space cowboy.

,
KZZ seems to be fine without getting either the aghs or a refresher in the majority of his omni games regardless of length, though he has a specific playstyle to the hero. His winrate also isn't trash despite not playing the hero 1500 times, that other guy shows why rmm is such a joke.

In the same game our viper mid went corrosive skin first against a nevermore and obviously lost hard (0-5). ,
Then we had a pudge+skywrath bottom lose their lane so I just fed until it was over. Pretty sure solo rating means nothing because of how random your teammates are and party rating means jack shit because you stack against autistic children that end up on your team in solo queue. Not sure why I bother playing DotA 2 anymore, it's filled with the dumbest fucking people and I'm not claiming I'm amazing or anything I just think I deserve people who are going to try rather than feed & troll. ,

/rant from a 4.4k player who mainly queues solo support which is impossible to gain rating as unless you're past the peruvian pub rating.

After everyone had picked except him, he picks Tidehunter, a less-than-optimal support in a trilane.

As we're inevitably losing our throne to Team Precision Aura, the team starts to toss around blame like Ebola in West Africa, until Deviruchi, when questioned on his 0-9 record, said ""lol u actually expect tidehunter to get kills?"" ,

always picks hard farming cores and sucks ass, doesn't communicate,

like last night he picked lone druid, and everyone thought he was offlane, didnt say a word or anything, so we end up having our sandking run to the offlane after the first creepwave is already spawned and down by the radiant tower, and this motherfucker is in the jungle,
,
and then as im trying to get my bottle at whatever 1:15 or something, not even that fast, he keeps spam clicking turning it around, and does this for like a straight minute so he can bring himself a gloves of haste + salve to his jungle. Literally sat there spam moving the courier, all the way back to base, then all the way over to his jungle.,
,
Fuck Fuck FUCKFUCK FUCK ,
,
this was the first time i've felt compelled to ruin a game i just bought a mask of death and followed him around in the jungle until the game ended.,
 i was actually quite annoyed like a solid 7 or 8 out of 10 on the mad scale,
,
and hes ruined like 4 of my games prior to this with similiar shit. i just fuckin snapped.,
,
also if anyone played sc2 this is the same kid who did a 1base 4gate in every single matchup over and over and over and over and over it was all HE FUCKING DID,
,
,
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							that was like a third of protosses
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							no you don't understand, every map, every matchup, EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. FOR HUNDREDS OF GAMES IN A ROW,
,
,
this was not early wings, this was like late wings, when people never did that shit anymore. this was when people did 2gate expands in pvp or 3gate expand stalker pressure or 1gate robo expand, and people nexus firsted or forge expanded in pvz. 1. base. 4. gate. with. one. gas. zealot stalker run across the map, summon either 4 zealots or 4 stalkers, and YOLO boys.,
,
EVERY FUCKING TIME,
,
EJIF EVKEFK{SKDko[pdfkoawkdopwKDOPKOPKWEPOK WHAT HTE UFCK,
,
and now the motherfuckers graduated to RUINING FUCKING DOTA GAMES,
,
SHIT PISS FUCK COCK ASS
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							oh oh oh and then i had THIS FUCKING GAME,
,
,
be playing jungle furion, okay that's pretty shitty or whatever but i try to do it right. i buy courier, i buy wards, i play hard support, and i buy mek with my first gold. i tp to lanes and push and do the 1 treant run past tower shit so we can take t1s. this fucking PIECE OF SHIT RETARD the terrorblade ,
,
WHO ONLY PICKS HARD FARMING CORES AS WELL, WOW IM SEEING A PATTERN HERE  ,
,
THIS FUCKING GUy has a yasha and brown boots at 18 minutes when his lane was fucking EASY AS FUCK. Our t1 top is dead right, we're radiant, and he's up in fucking NO MANS LAND farming near the DIRE SIDE SHOP, and he dies to the void/tinker gank shit. Then he does the same thing again. Every time he dies, he says, on his mic, in his slightly autistic sounding voice ""wow furion wheres the mek dude"",
,
I try to control myself, but I end up saying some haughty response, pretty quick, about how he has ""no farm"" and ""700"" hp. which he did. Literally, 715 hp, at the fucking 18 FUCKING MINUTE MARK.,
,
Okay , it's whatever, some people are bad, nothing to see here right. So i'm lv 11, and the other team has a tinker, and i have some gold in my pocket from sucessful ganks + towers taken, so I decide to get a late midas (19 or 20 minutes). A bit questionable, but as my hero still has 14 fucking levels to grow, and only has a mek, I think hey, that's not half bad, seeing as if the enemy tinker is any good at all it will take us 45 minutes more to win, and the other void is so farmed anyway we prolly lost.,
,
this MOTHERFUCKER EXPLODES and starts MASS PINGING MY HERO as soon as the thing pops up on the right side that says I bought. He starts going OH MY GOD FURION UR SO BAD BLA BLA BLA U NEVER GET MIDAS PAST 7 miuntes. I calmy try to tell him that said rule is really only for the safelane, and sometimes the mid heroes, that supports and offlaners commonly get a late midas. His response, and I FUCKING QUOTE ""NOONE IN THE HISTORY OF PROFESSIONAL DOTA HAS EVER GOT A LATE MIDAS U RETARD I WATCH PROS ALL THE TIME"" So I ask him what I should have got. Should I have got an oblivion staff, pieces of a necro one? Yeah that sounds great let me get a necro1 and RUN INTO THE SIDELANES AND DIE TO THE DAGON TINKER AND FARMED FUCKING VOID. No, I went with a midas so we actually can have a chance of winning, also as I'm the only one buying wards it will be nice to have guaranteed ward money as most of our jungle should be being farmed considering how unsafe the lanes are given teh fucking TINKER AND VOID. HE STARTS SPAMMING THE >I WILL PURCHASE HAND OF MIDAS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND SITS IN FOUNTAIN TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO ME HOW YOU CANT GET A LATE MIDAS ON A SUPPORT HERO AND HOW ""NOBODY IN PRO GAMES EVER DOES THAT"",
,
THis MOTHERFUCKER had 4100 mmr and his steam profile has him in the ""Reddit"" Group. I actually had to take deep breaths not to scream at this motherfucker. Luckily I just downloaded the entire ""fappening"" torrent so I could just alt tab and go calm down while looking at that. God what a FUCKING PIECE OF SHTI MORON FUCKFUCKFIJKWFDIKJWID,
,
Here is the game in question ,
,
I was TWO LEVELS HIGHER THAN THIS FUCKING MOTHERFUCKER AND I GOT MY LEVEL 6 SO FUCKING LATE, I HAD LIKE A FUCKING 11 MINUTE MEK WITH NO BROWN BOOTS FUCK HTIS FWDOKWDOKD FUCKF UCK FUCK FUCK SHIT PISS ASS COCK,

can you fucking die already and stop playing dota? half my games i've lost this entire week have been solely because of TECHIES and the most infuriating part about TECHIES pickers is when they think that their TECHIES pick did anything other than stall the game to 40+ minutes when we couldve fucking won the game at 30 minutes if you had picked literally any other hero and the reason i know this is because you were fucking placing mines on the outskirts of their fucking base instead of doing any kind of damage to try and help push down a raxx. this happens literally every fucking game with techies when you get an advantage and when people still keep picking the fucking hero like they're doing their team some kind of favor drives me up a fucking wall. im tired of losing mmr because you fucking knuckledraggers and ur fucking god complexes think you're some sort of exception to the techies rule which is: ,

He's some Peruvian around 4.7k but he plays like a 3.5k who bought a 5k account and is mean regressing. Every game I've played with him, he picks mid and does shit like farm mid lane on the enemy's side of the river 35 mins into the game during the night time with no vision and gets himself killed. Absolutely no map or situation awareness. ,
,

it's not his fault he was in a game with high rated players.  i mean he's probably about your standard 4.3ker but he still went 2-3-2-0 at level 7 so it's hard not to hate him
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Idk, maybe sometimes you should have the humility to ask for an MMR check before you pick a big dick hero/lane like TA/mid. I queue against godzhand a lot who's ~6.3k and I literally get people 2k mmr less than him take mid against him. One game, I said ""i think WR mid, tinker safe"" and this 4.2k SF goes ""doesn't matter, gonna rape whoever comes mid"". Here's the result: ,.,
,
Here's another game where a 4.3k ember called mid and said before the creeps spawned he was gonna make WR taste his ass and shit all over him. 40 minute battlefury status: 60%. ,
,
They need to make MMR visible @ hero selection.
						"

is us west pool so small you can get queued with and vs friends every time o.0,

edit: i like the idea of having mmr visible during picking phase.,
srsly i'd win 100% if my sub 5k players pick treant/cm and never leave base thanks to the armor and aura

						"

							well he started swearing at everyone in spanish.  i guess we kinda deserved it because everyone was giving him shit.  i mean he was really bad and useless but it's valve's fault for not ordering the players by mmr so at least u have some clue  u shouldnt gomid if you're brown/orange
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,west seems smaller than east. west has a lot of retards.  east has a lot of south american players with higher ping/maybe worse attitudes.  i dunno if they actyally have worse attitudes, most people have shitty fucking attitudes including me.
						"

							godzhand is a good player, he's like top30 in leaderboards..
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							He's currently rank 13 with 6278 mmr.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i mean maybe he abuses, i dont know. do you have any proof bayonetta? i've played with/against him and he's genuinely a good player
						"

							i have him on my friends list and he's quite good and a pretty cool guy

							He doesn't abuse lol.
						"

							Kyle SHUT THE FUCK UP
						"

							if hes not abusing he would play in us east but its harder for him and his friends to be in same match there
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							maybe its both. maybe he can play dota but hes obliged to abuse as well.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,what if... he lives on us west?! oh wow
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,much wow 10 ms ping improvement!
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
MMR should be shown at the start of the game or organzied by color ,
and i dont think he abuses just dodges,
,
surprised hes such a high mmr  he plays a decent wr/invoker thats about it,
hes not some insanely skilled mechanical beast either he just avoids good players,
so hes farming mmr off trash
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i live on east and when i play east i get 30ping, when i play west i get 110.,
,
its not 10ms difference. you play on west too if you're complaining about playing with him so you much be abusing too, huh?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							no i dont play on west, i can play fine on us east with 200 ms ping but i stopped bcuz of peru ,
,
plz stop lying, he is abusing, im not a frequent player in us west but it must be a nightmare for a 6k+ player to queue in such a small player pool and i bet the mmr gap is 2k+ as well,
,
,but he is playing with much lower MMR rated teammates and if he dodges vs ""good"" players aka 6k+ players, that means he must be facing 4.8k-5.5ks~ while he is playing with sub 4k retards,
,
also dodging is abuse too... montano (7.4k mmr slark picker) got banned for dodging.

i think hes pretty bad to dodge this 5.5k ember named ember god of mid lol ,

						"

							Anyway now I feel bad for getting the kid's name involved in this cesspool because it's not like he came here boasting about how good he was or better than any of you. Relax guys. I don't have anything to gain by saying this but he doesn't abuse or dodge good players. You can see for yourself on his stream ,

							i guess u can watch his stream and draw ur own conclusions, ive drawn mine
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,lol i dont think thoras beat him 5-1,
he seems legit but i think his secret is that he just dodges alot i watched his stream and he always d/c whenever he sees any good players and he doesnt even dodge right,
does at the start not the 10 sec window,
,
i think any player that beats him he mutes and puts on the dodge list,
hes got to be doing something right though to jump from 5-6k in like a week or whatever ,
,
i mean he lost to this autistic ember,
,
,
honestly still shocked at how he manages to climb the mmr ladder
						"

I won't link his profile but I'll just say he has literally 1,200+ games of TA played and not all of his games are recorded on Dotabuff because he privates it from time to time. Absolutely no game sense, but I guess that's just what happens when you only play TA, Viper, Drow & Juggernaut for 2,000+ games.

If early game goes well, mid game you can transition into more dps oriented items. If early game goes badly then arc/mek still allow PotM to be useful into the late game.

I mainly pick doom tho because I don't want my allies picking it and going into the jungle . . . . I also don't want one of my enemies picking him either

						"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"

						"

						"

						"

							ill probably start playing rmm again next patch but i just dont want to deal with the retards who wait until the picks end in order to counterpick or the annoyance of deaaling with earth spirit/doom/tinker/void/etc every fucking game

							hey kzz senpai maybe u should fuck around with some good friends with beenfits no?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							my 42% winrate smurf I used whenever I got muted just got calibrated to 4.9 this explains so much
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							im not 5.5k or whatever but i still dont understand how all pick is better than cd/cm. is it queue times? at the very least atleast we dont have tinker void doom every game,
,
even when i get 4.2kers on my team and the insta pick captain its not THAT bad. still just as winnable as any all pick game
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							doesnt matter if you caused ur team to lose significantly more than half ur games as long as u got good gpm in your first ten games you are In There
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,games are about ten minutes shorter and you get to play what you want.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							30 minutes of misery versus 40 minutes of decent dota
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							normal match making is actually really fun. nobody rages cuz it's casual and everyone is just trying to have a good time.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,can attest, queueing unranked rd with friends is pretty fun
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							well the higher you go the larger mmr gaps will be in games,
,
that means as you go up some random guy picking captain is more likely to skew the game one way or the other ,
,
nobody wants to lose because somebody hundreds of mmr below got outpicked by a far superior player and stuck you on shit you don't even wanna play
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,that sounds equally as bad as having void doom tinker every game
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ya I think CD/CM for solo pubbing is just as bad as AP too,
,
which is why RD would be nice. good balance between hero variety/no gay shit spam and you being able to pick what you want
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							rd is awful because ppl will go afk and shit, then start whining about their hero
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							that's their fault
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							orange and brown players will also become bottom of the barrel players again
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yeah idk why valve patched that shit when rmm became visible at the end of a match,
it was so obvious whenever orange/brown wanted mid and u could just tell them to fuck off ,
,
i just lost to some 4k trash calling mid just to play lina ,
,
why
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if ap was removed and rd added to rmm then you wouldnt have those afkers,
,
youd get most people moving to cd/cm tho which would result in some cancer games for a while at least
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,yeah hes an annoying faggot. what mmr is he even?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							they should bring back the orange/brown being the lowest mmr, that shit was comedy
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							wasnt that que time and not mmr but its usually correlated
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I got Felony in MM once and he died like 15 times in 15 minutes as sf mid
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i played a game a few nights ago with a frequent poster on NADota and he went 0-6 as SF mid in 8 minutes, i forgot who though
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							not me
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i'd say it was me but i dont think im in ur mmr range
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							nah he was low 4k or something. low 4k's always take my mid
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Jing?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ExiOrca is some tryhard chink who immediately starts asking people to pick meta mids and supports so he can carry with dumb heroes (PA this time) and starts theorycrafting about builds before the game even starts. Not at all a surprise when he does absolutely nothing and blames his entire team.,
,
Wicked Lady is probably a mid to late 20 year old who has a couple kids who decided to queue up for Dota 2 again and forgot that people call you names if you do absolutely nothing all game and got really upset and started questioning everyone's mental status because we don't like putting up with bad players,

							mms so bad.  along with its other issues u just get really awful people who just stomp unranked games and then get into top tier games somehow.  theyre so obvious too they jsut go ssome retard build and run around feeding and wondering why their game doesnt play out like the unranked games theyre used to.  valve really could not have done a worse job on their matchmaking.

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i dont think its possible to drop below 50% winrate after calibration unless you intentionally lose every game like i did on my smurf
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I wonder if I should play some more MM now that the b version is out
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							, notable things about this game: huskar has a 47% win rate and went 5-19 becasue thats how he normally plays, shadow shaman flamed me and dual laned mid with me because I wouldnt go to the 0 minute rune with him, necro went arcane soul ring, doom exclusivley doomed the clock that already used all of his spells instead of the omniknight or any other hero, they ended up going a combined 11-49.

							lately im getting a bunch of fucking retards who are buying irrelevant items or are just completely oblivious to everything in the game. like who the fuck gets battlefury on void. i've seen that shit three times out of 30 games in 6.82. and they're always on my team. I dont see people going morphling mid on the enemy team. I don't ever see people rushing crimson guard on disruptor on the enemy team.  I don't ever see any of this retarded shit. at most i'll see someone just throw the game intentionally but that happens equally to me so it's not even part of the discussion.,
,
im sure this is just confirmation bias and i'm sure i'll bounce back and get less retards in future games and maybe i'll stay above 5k this time but there's just been so many games in a row with some of the most compelling arguments for eugenics that it's really getting to me. i dont know how much more i can take of this horseshit, guys. what do i do? suicide isnt an option unfortunately
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if void gets bfury at 14 or before, im ok with it, more farm with the regen which means he doesnt have the excuse if I tp i dont have mana for chrono
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							he got it at 20 minutes,
,
and no its never justified what the fuck
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							battlefury void is perfectly fine u retard
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							can i see your justification because honestly rush battle fury void just seems like a subpar idea nowadays. i say this as someone who has probably bought more battle furies than the average player
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							there are obvious tradeoffs.  battlfury has a roh which is nice for laning.  it helps u farm faster after it's done.  the cleave isn't bad inside chrono honestly.,
,
the downside compared to mom -> maelstrom is that mom let you solo kill fairly early and join fights earlier.  ,
,
i really don't see what the problem with bfury void is as long as you have space and a safe lane.   if you can get away with it, it's going to be a strong build.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Bfury was the main build before off lane voids with treads mom rush was a thing
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							m fully aware of what battle fury does okay i clearly wouldnt be complaining about void going bfury if it was beneficial to the game, in context ofc. but it never is
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,morph mid owns tho  hes like an LC you can stick him in any lane and itll still be fine very versatile hero,
,
morph mid is very pub stompy guess ur morphs just suck
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,relaly i started playing dota in 6.80 thanks for the tidbit
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							derpaderpaderp,

you ask to know why its viable, you are told why it is, you deny it,
,
so basically you didnt mean to ask why, you meant to just be mad at that guy cuz you lost and it was probably ur fault
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							there are plenty of void players especially in rmm who would be better off going bfury because they aren't joining fights anyway
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							marcbase - stfu,
,
and so that makes it okay for voids to go battle fury? shouldnt all voids just be casting chronospheres off CD and winning teamfights for their team? just because a few idiots technically wouldnt be useful anyawys doesnt mean it's equally viable, right?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							What's wrong with morph mid,
I don't understand people on this website's vendettas against heroes not named doom razor viper.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i think mom maelstrom is a stronger build in general but i wouldn't flame someone for going battlefury.  there's more than 1 good build for any given hero.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i've seen even necro voids,
,
i never complain as long as they do well.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							alright holy shit guys i've seen plenty of people do fine with unconventional builds. i'm not completely oblivious to the fluidity of item builds and hero laning in this game.,
,
my point is that i'm getting people lately that cant do this shit and they try to do it anyways. yeah, i've seen morphling go mid and crush. i've also seen 9 more morphlings go mid and end up with 1k networth at 15 minutes in. i wouldn't be bitching about this if they weren't ruining more games than they were helping.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							they could be practicing :O
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							practicing is fine but why do people feel the need to bring in things they aren't certain on into a ranked game? i suck ass with shadow fiend, and you would never catch me picking that hero in ranked because i know damn well i'd feed my ass off 5 games out of 10, a non-factor in 3 out of 10, and effective in maybe 2. this is also why i dislike people who constantly random in ranked.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i'm not exactly disagreeing with you. i would probably be annoyed as well.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							it's cool man im not trying to antagonize or anything, i'm just having a rough dota week and i need to vent b4 this leaks into real life
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I random 80% of games and I'm 5.3k go me,

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Ty
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							np
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							isn't it more justifiable to go bfury now because games are guaranteed to last longer and kill streaks being ended from early game aggression can swing games in the enemies favor? idk bfury used to be pretty ass because you were essentially giving up and going for the ""sort of an AM"" build
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							bfury is fine but all the players that buy it get it at like 25 minutes with naked boots since they're garbage and want to match their cosmetic,
,
this makes people think it's a trash item, since 90% of the time it's a trash player.,
,
also morph mid is like twice as good now since you can ult if you die and get instant tp to lane(illusion doesn't die with hero anymore). buying back, ulting to illusion and killing after death is pretty much worth it in the early game with the new xp and gold changes.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ranked games are a joke im pretty usre ur taking them too seriosuly.  Theyre literally just ap pubs and u wanna flame people for practicing stuff.  get over it theyre going to play what they want and they probably dont do much worse than how they would normally play anyway
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							no i need 6k for revouch stfu
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if its hard for u to get 6k u probably shouldnt be in nel
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							so my void used chrono to save a dark seer,
,
dark seer a shell on he has about 500 hp, our clockwerk hooks the guy, then we hgave void that comes in and ults the dark seer by itself, we then have void with 200 hp who has to run aw3ay from the shell... ,

other game I hav ethis weaver,
,
I tp to his lane im abadon i  tel;l be careful ( were palying agianst vs lesh and tiny),

he tells me when i go to the lane they have sentries, he then goes in gets stuned, i shield gets stuned one more time and dies
						"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							also played with a 4.3k mmr ember spirit dying to tinker 3 times b4 I rotated saying ""why is he not maxing march??""  ,
,
it didn't help that he sounded like a younger kyle
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							At least you didn't have a morphling against tinker who was forced out of lane every 30 seconds because he was morphed down to 400hp,

mag was like 8-0 offlane and rhasta abandoend then u said we r so far up ur guna start taking cs and blocking creep camps, then we started to lose and u said we can all join u in ur misery while u bitches and moaned and said that ur whinning is more fun tahn actualy playing and winning

i am now a moderator so i will do my best to keep really shit people out, regardless of their mmr.  at the same time it doesn't make sense for me to unvouch people just bc i dnot like them or becausr they had a bad game.,
,
i believe NEL will be populated when professional players come and play there.  rmm offers similar quality games in terms of player skill once you get up to 6k if you queue at the right time so the difference is all pick vs CM really.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

How to avoid the mmr rollercoaster. This has happened to me about 50 times now. I almost get to 5k mmr, then I get a series of impossible games (players that throw and pick bad comps) back to back and lose all of my progress.,

						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"

							valve should really clear out all ranked accounts with any zeus in the calibration games.,
,
3k level players with 5k mmr are ,.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,valve should just get rid of the mmr system in general it's fucking garbage,
,
list of priorities for ranked matchmaking:,
,
1. get rid of mmr, add division-based system that isn't entirely based off of win/loss,
2. remove AP, banning pick preferred,
3. ban kyle's IP from dota 2 servers
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,im pretty sure there isn't a better metric than W/L that wouldn't be painfully complicated to implement/understand, the whole problem with zeus arose because valve didn't base their calibration on W/L. ,
,
the current system sucks but league's division based system just makes everyone in the lowest division of their tier = garbage. valve can replicate the same thing by lowering MMR spread at higher MMRs.. having a tier/division based system won't get rid of idiots.,
,
also the calibration phase doesn't make much sense anyway because your unranked games should be your calibration. requirements for ranked are so low that anyone can just make a new account to play if they feel their original account doesnt reflect their skill. a streak system where having 5+ games or whatever gives you bonus points would make more sense to me.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Honestly all I want is the party mmr to be regarded as however many the group is at the highest mmr in the group,

for exemple, you have 5.5k and your friends are 3.9 and 4.2, mmr should be regarded as 3x 5.5k

							RMM is cancer. It's by far the worst matchmaking system I've played out of Dota 1, HoN, and Dota 2. I wish I could play NEL, but I'm not 5k. ,
,
There is absolutely no correlation between your rank and skill in this game. With all the exploits (Zeus), bought accounts, peruvians, and team rank pollution, matches are just ridiculously stupid.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I don't think being 5k means you a good player (for example, the retard on USW with 1100+ games of TA & 2.9 KDA), but a good player should be able to get 5k+ if they wanted. After a couple thousand games, if you can't get 5k+ despite trying hard in RMM, it's time to accept that you're the common denominator in all your losses.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							And yeah, if you struggle to make it to 5.1k, what makes you think you'll have an edge vs. top NA players/actual pros and won't be bottom of the barrel, target practice for them? You sound like someone in poker who barely breaks even/loses slightly @ $1/2 and thinks they need to move up to $5/10 games because 1/2 players are irrational and unpredictable.

							,Personally my operating assumption is that I feel like there is a stronger urge to win when I am playing with a small handful (maybe a few hundred) players in a league where the main purpose is to have fun, mannered, competitive games.,
,
Within those leagues, sure there are people who occasionally troll or do bm shit to try to swindle wins but at least there are genuine mechanisms in place to ensure that those kinds of players are at least implicitly punished. A game ruiner for example will get unvouched, kicked from startgames, or removed from .cl's. ,
,
The same cannot be said of rmm. At most you're sent to the playpen and have to nut out a few bot games before you're right back where you started. This creates a strong incentive for game ruiners to continue to do what they do if they derive more enjoyment from doing so than actually playing the fucking game like a mens. Communication is also supposed to be a bare minimum thing in these games.,
,
I don't know how exactly NEL operates or how it's supposed to operate, but the general consensus was that whoever was made leader of the game had to be listened to for better or worse. This made dota a thing of mutual respect because one game you might be a leader and the next you might be a follower. ,
,
There is no such requirement in rmm. They can bm and ignore advice from the players who are doing well, people pick heroes for themselves instead of the team without a second thought. For fuck's sake feeding 10 or more times in a row isn't even punishable in rmm. The probability of running into the same person multiple times is low enough that it is worth decreasing mutual ties with the people in the current game for personal trolling purposes. At least in leagues you have the option of holding the mere threat of a ban over someone's head and they'll tuck their inflated epeen between their legs and listen the fuck up.,
,
Dota should be about a lot more than finding something with >.5 win % and fucking spamming that shit 999999 times for personal profit. It's supposed to be a community.

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,how are even able to say that like it has any significance whatsoever? they fixed some bugs. they didnt change a damn thing about how ranked matchmaking operates on a fundamental level. their inability to make meaningful changes to the way rmm works speaks very loudly. and no, changing the (already) best mode to queue for into something barely better doesn't count.,
,
,i cant really agree with this as I was only 1700 in HoN b4 they reworked their ranking(which is like barely 4k in Dota 2, i think) but it felt better than dota 2's,
,1 seems good, 2 seems to be overdoing it.,
,
i think they need to add more checks and counters to evaluate players and assign them to divisions accordingly. when valve soft enforces 50% winrate, it seems a little counterproductive to have a ranking system that only cares about win/loss after your initial evaluation.
						"

							,The system makes even matches assuming you're at the correct MMR. If your MMR is higher than it should be, you'll lose more than you win, causing your MMR to decrease. If your MMR is lower than it should be, you'll win more than you lose, causing your MMR to increase. The system is in no way counterproductive. Basing it off of anything other than win/loss allows players to abuse the system, as seen recently with zeus pickers in calibration.

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,So you would be opposed to a modified system where instead of a solid mmr gain/loss across the board for each player in the game, players would instead gain/lose mmr based on performance? I've been in thousands of games where people play like complete ass, and they'll still gain 25 mmr. I've seen games where people play out of their mind, and still lose 25 mmr. Even further so, I've seen plenty of games where players gain mmr simply because they happened to be on the right team against an intentional thrower. Having a system that takes away or adds to your solo ranking when you have to rely on four other people really, really sucks. A well-designed system would also prevent any serious abuse from popping up, because there would still be no way for a losing player to gain rating, except for maybe in the most extreme of circumstances.,
,
I'm not speaking from a position of authority on matchmaking systems but I can't see any serious issues with this as long as the foundation is solid.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,what's performance? KDA? everyone will autolock cores and MM will be more miserable. wards bought? people will ward spam or some shit at the end of games. there are too many factors to consider when determining a player's skill, luckily all of those factors can be summed up as to whether that player causes his team to win more than 50% of the time at that MMR.,
,
the system could be better but using non-win/loss metrics would be a step backward and would open the system to abuse/make MM more miserable.

						"

							,The people that perform better individually and consistently do so will win more games over time. Thus they'll win more MMR and the poor performers will lose MMR.

valve should let you decide your own starting mmr, make it an honor system! And the amount of mmr you gain every match is based off of friendliness that is calculated by commends and post game satisfaction surveys! And you can't lose mmr!,

,
I'm mid 4k mmr, and I rarely meet 5k players that are better than me.,
,
If you look at the conditions of ranked mm games right now they are not in the state to actually allow a skilled player to reliably increase his mmr unless you are very lucky or use an exploit or group queue.

							it would be kinda sick if there were 100 calibration games that determined the type of hero you're most likely to pick. based on that assigned role you get different elo algorithms for performance (if they wanted to, this could also be excluded if too difficult) and teams are more cohesive as far as picks are concerned. I also think a hearthstone-esque dota 2 seasonal ladder would be dope. people win enough games to get into ""legend"" bracket and play vs other legends every game.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,i was thinking about having a system like the WoW LFG system, where you would designate what role/lane you wanted to play for each game and then you would get placed into a game once you found 9 other players to fill every role/lane. people would join and the role they selected would be indicated.  if you wanted to play mid every game, then you would queue for mid. mid being the most popular role, it would also take the longest to find a game for, but that would be the price you pay and it would be worth it to not have to fight and argue over mid. it'd ideally foster more teamplay because everyone would know what to expect from the rest of their team in regards to who is going to be going where, allowing the team to focus on picks and strategizing. obviously there would be a lot of unseen downsides to this, and i didn't really spend a lot of time hashing it out, but it's one of the ideas i've been kicking around
						"

							its so relaxing to play with disabled dotabuff, u can feed on purpose, sell items + spam couriers for lulz but i'll regret it when i enable dotabuff,
,
wat do
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I've never liked this idea I'll be totally honest. Very few people are tied down to only one role. Past that it seems like queue times would get more fucked up and it seems easier to abuse than a regular queue system. Dota never used to be about 1-5 roles and being a ""healer/tank/dps LFG"" and I'd hope it stays that way.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,one of the reasons why i dont think it would really work out. even though plenty of people wouldn't pick the same role, i know i definitely wouldnt. but still, it would warp the way the game is approached too significantly for me to think it would be a net positive change
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Yeah i pick my hero based on how bad my teammates seem and if i need to afk farm, offlane,  support, or mess around b/c we're gonna lose anyways.,
,
They also need to limit the # of couriers you can buy in game, or at least set a timer so you can't just mass buy and feed. Or if one user repeatedly feeds couriers they get a harsher mmr penalty. ,
,
Calibration should be tied to what heroes you pick, and how well you do with that hero compared to the average (which, if dotabuff has that info, valve does too). I got screwed over for picking supports.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Wtf lol are you nuts,

i love buying couriers, especially when others try to tell me what to do with their stupid voice
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,exactly
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							mmr sucks because i suck,
,
we shall instate a whole new system designed around something other than winning.,
,
because is dota about anything other than winning. if i feed in lane 10 times but pull off plays later in the game that get the win, do i deserve to lose mmr? ,
,
dota is literally only about taking the throne, and that's the only way you can measure someone - by how often they get the throne.

						"

							Then why do Naga go radiance??
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if u dont get like 10cs/min on naga or tb then ur playing like shit and you dont have as much farm as you should so ur not as useful jserus christ you peopel

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							jesus
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							CASUE TB WITH regular non radiance items farms nearly as fast and has much more impact in the early stages of the game. u can say similar shit for naga i guess but i just think radiance does more for a naga than a tb cuz # of illu and ur more ratty of a hero
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							rads better on naga cause her str + str gain is better than tb's str + str gain, also mirror image illus take less dmg at lv's 3 and 4,
,
her riptide + radience on her illus lets you bully heroes out of lane or force the enemy team to preemptively use mek in a push, something that a tb can't do with his illusions,
,
naga is better at holding high ground because of the previous point, you just suicide a single illusion with riptide +rad and do like 300 dmg, and u still have 2 remaining to suicide which u can carefully place on the edge of the t3 high ground to slowly tick them down,
,
tb has some serious hp issues and needs to stack as much hp as quickly as possible to be able to survive the initial nukes, and rad wont help in this regard (and in these cases the enemy team is already doing a high ground push)
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							why r u crying mongoloid both teams had balanced mmr,
,
omfg i swear old 4k is new 5k,
,
,
regarding radiance on naga, i only buy it to aggro creeps on the lane so i can get rid of backdoor and dmg towers/raxes, i would rather stack up my hp on tb if anything
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							who cares anyone eho plays either hero sucks shit and should die

						"

							A melee hc doesn't stand a chance against tide, unless his supports properly zone him out. I'd say the fault is either that the lanes weren't changed or his supports failed horribly. Also, what is a stout shield gonna do vs anchor smash. I'm not convinced you're very good Lurie.

							Hi all. When ranked mm first came out I calibrated at 3.7k. I'm now 5.5k solo, though I've been hovering in and out of the leaderboards for the last week. I thought I might share some of my thoughts on gaining mmr that might be helpful/new to many of you. Everything here refers to solo queue, though most of it's also applicable to playing with friends.,
MMR is a reflection of someone's overall skill level. However, given how complex of a game dota is, it's a relatively coarse measurement. Some people might say MMR doesn't mean anything, and they would be wrong. It is, by definition (ie, you gain mmr when you win and you lose mmr when you lose), a measurement of how capable you are at winning games.,
As a reflection of your skill level, you can't increase your mmr in the long term (ie, ignoring short term fluctuations due to randomness) without actually becoming better at winning games. This sentence is a little vague, and some ways of making the sentence precise are false, but essentially the philosophy behind this, is that in order to increase your mmr you must either A) Become a better player, or B) Make your team play better.,
I will first consider option (A) above - ie, getting better at dota. Now, there are tons of guides applicable to all sorts of skill ranges that discuss this in varying levels of detail, so what I'm going to focus on aren't the details. I'm going to consider the big picture, which is.,
So how do you get better at ANYTHING? Suppose you want to learn to play Chopin's Ballade in G minor. This is a very difficult piece of music for the piano, and is about 8-10 pages long (iirc). If you want to get better at playing this, you could begin by sightreading it and trying to play the entire thing extremely slowly, which could take you as much as 20-30 minutes depending on how much you stumble. And then maybe you could do it again, and again, and again. Eventually you'll get better at the piece, but this would be an extremely inefficient way of learning the piece. Why? Because your brain doesn't have enough working memory to store the entire playthrough of the piece, along with all the little details and bits that you stumbled on, so if you stumbled on a part near the beginning, by the time you've reached the end 20 minutes later, you've probably forgotten about that stumble near the beginning, and it becomes difficult to use the memory of that stumbling to get better at playing that part in future playthroughs. Instead, what pretty much every piano student does, is to divide the piece into parts, and practice each part thoroughly before moving on to the next part. The parts may vary in length between only a few measures to an entire page, with the most difficult parts being the shortest in length (so you can play them as many times as possible in a reasonable practice session). The same philosophy holds in dota. It's really difficult to just become a better dota player without focusing on the areas you need to improve on. However, instead of dividing up dota into aspects like last hitting, map awareness, etc. I think it's just as reasonable to divide it into heroes. If you want to get better at dota, what I would advocate, is picking a small list of heroes (maybe 2-4 heroes) that you just focus on getting better at, and play them all 10-20 times each. This takes us to the next step.,
SELF-ASSESSMENT... is hard, especially with such a complex game as dota. In fact, assessing how well you're doing, what you need to improve on, is difficult no matter what you're trying to learn. This is why people hire teachers/go to class. Now, while I think hiring a high-mmr player to coach you will definitely help you get better, I understand many dota players are poor and don't want to use what little cash they have this way (buying hats is obviously a much better use of your money o.0). Honestly, I can't tell you how to best analyze your own play. There are so many things to consider for that to write them here would make this post literally unreadable. However, I can say that honestly the key to getting better, is to NEVER go into a game hoping to win. Winning is great, but ultimately it is a side effect to playing well, and your goal going into every game is to play well. You should constantly be thinking about what your best next move is. Sometimes you will need to coordinate with your team, but every time you try to coordinate you should know that there's a chance they don't cooperate, in which case you should have a backup plan for what you should do if they don't cooperate. If you think you should gank the enemy carry but you need the help of your mid, you can ask him to help you, but if he says no or doesn't respond, going in solo would be stupid, so have a backup plan! (which could even be to just farm).,
Why shouldn't you go into a game hoping to win? Because it's too easy to spend anywhere from 10 seconds to a few minutes dwelling on your allies mistakes (every time they happen) and pondering your own misfortune at being teamed up with these idiots instead of thinking about what you should be doing right now. For me, often when I hit a record mmr I become terrified of losing it, and as a result the next time I play a game and someone on my team (or even me) makes a mistake I might spend 30s arguing with them if it was their mistake or defending myself if it was my mistake, during which I just go into autopilot and stop thinking about how to best spend my time. I can't count the number of times this has caused me to lose focus, not watch the map as closely, and get ganked, exacerbating the problem. If you don't focus on winning, but instead on playing well recognizing the fact that there's roughly a 50% chance of you losing this game, then it becomes easier to just note the mistakes that were made, move on, and maintain your focus. Plus, this way, it's easier to look back on every game and feel good about the lessons you've learned that game. Whether you won or lost is irrelevant. If you're learning from mistakes then you're becoming a better player, and your mmr will naturally increase in the long term as a result. To this end, if you don't have a tough skin, don't be afraid to mute people who flame you. Personally in the loading screen of every game, I make sure I unmute everyone. Then, once the game starts, as soon as someone flames me I tell them if they keep flaming me in a nonconstructive manner I'm going to mute them, and I follow through with the promise. Yes dota is a team game and communication is important to winning, but in the end your goal should be to focus on your own play and play well, and if your teammates are making that difficult for you then muting them is the obvious solution (and may make you end up winning the game anyway thanks to your better play).,
The next goal to have when going into a game is to use the data you get from the game to revise the model of the game that you have in your head. I can't count the number of times I've gotten doomsayers on your team saying ""omg that AM is so farmed its gg"", or ""gg no gank spectre"". Then, when the teamfights roll in their AM or specter gets hexed and blown up or somehow get kited or don't do enough damage and you win. If you find yourself saying something like that and then still end up winning the game, you should really think about at the end of the game why you were wrong. Honestly, there could be a thousand reasons. Generally this comes in two flavors. Firstly, maybe your team actually had good ways to deal with the enemy no matter how farmed they get, in which case identifying the factors that let your team deal with the enemy carry should be very valuable in making the model of dota you have in your head more accurate. Secondly, maybe your enemy carry made a mistake. Now this is much harder to identify, and unless you're a pro a lot of things you might consider mistakes actually aren't mistakes, and vice versa. Either way, even if he actually made a mistake, you should think - why did he make this mistake? What was he thinking? Is this a mistake that is often made at your mmr? For example, it's very common in mmrs below 4k to get absolute freefarm for the first 15 minutes and to think that you can just go ham on the enemy as a 1100 hp luna with treads drums midas dominator, without realizing that 1100 hp isn't actually very much and in a teamfight without a bkb you can easily get disabled and focused down before you can even press R (in fact it's an interesting aspect of dota that given two teams with exactly the same hero compositions and exactly the same items/levels, that teamfights will often be stomps in one way or the other - ie, good initiations and vision advantages via high grounds/wards is incredibly important). Anyway, if they made a mistake that is often made, then that's something you can exploit in the future when playing against a farmed <whatever>, and something you should note not to do when playing as a farmed <whatever>. In fact, if you understand why he made the mistake, you can even try to bait out the mistake by creating similar conditions in the future. For example, if 3v3 fight breaks out somewhere on the map (especially at a tower), often the other 4 heroes might watch the fight and try to decide if they should tp to help or keep farming. In that situation, the enemy carry might take an extra second to react to you trying to gank him with the 2 heroes on your team not in that fight and as a result die due to not backing up in time. Was that a mistake? Yes! Did you get lucky that he was slow to escape? Yes! But the point was that you made your own luck by timing the gank to coincide with a fight that caused him to look away from his hero.,
Of course, the above point relies on having accurate data. You can't improve your theory/model of how dota works without accurate data, which is sometimes difficult to collect in game, since things often happen so fast. However, thankfully there is such a thing as the amazing downloadable replay. If you're really serious about getting better at dota, then watching your replays is an absolute necessity. Knowing what to look for in a replay is difficult and I can't really write everything down, but a few things to consider are: How did this fight start? Were we looking for a fight? Should we have been looking for a fight? If we won/lost, did I think we were going to win/lose at the beginning of the fight? How does this fit with my theory of dota? Here, the last question is especially important, as often in mmrs below 4k, the vast majority of fights are actually just a cacophony of fuckups. Everyone misses their spells or uses them on the wrong targets, people run when they should be chasing or chase when they should be running, so it's incredibly important to understand what mistakes were made (especially by you), and to understand if the fight should have been a win or a loss. Of course, even most <5k players won't be able to actually answer these questions correctly, but at least thinking about the question allows you to have a basepoint from which you can adjust your answers/theory of dota in light of more data from future games and similar fights.,
I'm getting a bit tired now and so I'll end with this last point, which is - how do you make your team play better? (ie, (B) from point 2) A lot of people are emotional when they play dota, and the variation in the quality of someone's play from game to game in part can be attributed to their state of mind. People enjoy the feeling of being a part of a cooperative team who's got each others backs, so if you can somehow instill that feeling in your teammates, you're actually improving your ability to win the game without actually being any better at dota yourself (this is the second way of gaining mmr!) There are a number of ways to do this. Essentially, you just want to be serious, but friendly. You want to limit your communication to things that are useful to your teammates, such as missing calls, pinging runes, noting which enemy heros are carrying wards, where they placed them...etc. You should never flame allies. It will only make them play worse. You can point out mistakes your allies made only if you are positive it was a mistake, and if you think they are likely to make the same mistakes again in the same game, but you want to be as specific as possible, and never phrase it in an aggressive tone. Give your supports farm. A 2k networth support at 30 minutes is actually worthless. If you're a core hero feel free to tell your supports to take a lane when you're off ganking or when you're strong enough to jungle. This applies to other cores too. Sometimes after I start a tp to a lane to farm the incoming creep wave, a teammate will still tp there after me. That's obviously a waste of time for us, so I would generally say something like ""can I have this please"", and if he still tries to compete for the last hits, I'll just move into the jungle or do something else.,
Lastly, here's a trick I often use : At the beginning of the game, if I sense a bad atmosphere for whatever reason, I will find a reason to commend some player on my team (and actually commend them, and announce that you're commending them for <whatever>). The reason should only have to do with their attitude, not their skill, and ideally you should do this as early as possible. Everyone likes to be commended, so the person you commended will probably like you more, hence improving the team dynamics between you two, but more importantly, the people who weren't commended are now aware that you actually commend people, and as a result may subconsciously change their behavior in a way to also deserve a commend from you. For example, last night when I noticed that my game was on page 22 and hence I was probably playing with a bunch of 4k players, after our solo support said depressingly ""great, I'm solo support again..."", and proceeded to buy courier and wards, I instantly commended him and announced ""commended teal for his attitude"". That was honestly the best game I've ever had with a bunch of 4k strangers (he also continued to buy support items in a timely manner for the rest of the game!). Even if 3 of your teammates are already flaming each other right out of the gate, you can even commend the person who didn't say anything for ""keeping a cool head"" or something.,
TLDR:,
Focus on your own play. Never go into a game hoping to win. Always go into a game trying to play well and learn from mistakes.,
Keep a model/theory of dota in your head. Constantly think about how your experiences in games fits with that model, and adjust it accordingly. Watch replays.,
Happy teammates = better teammates. You can win games solely off of making your teammates feel good. Be friendly, but serious. Never flame. Make constructive criticism if you think it will help. Commend people for their attitude

							this is probably the 20th time i said it but if you ever queue at odd hours and u see chinks (typical chinese names), just dodge if they are in your team or against you, they plant like every game possible and they mass report u so u get put in low prio if you call them out for it
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yea that's typical of em
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i'm sure they plant because everything about their gameplay (mechanics, laning, farm efficiency, etc.) is god awful yet they somehow end up winning because there's 1-2 vegetables on the other team

						"

							at the end of the game sometimes u get the evaluate one of ur teammates thing.  if u urself get low ratings on some of those evaluations u start to get put with other people with low evaluations and people who get 1 stars are more likely to get matched with each other.  eventually u get to the bottom of the bunch for ur mmr bracket where the majority of teammates u get will be griefers, spam pingers, and really stupid people.,

i like how a ""fair"" mm system isn't putting similar skilled people in a pool and placing them in games together its just making teams with similar aggregate ratings which leads to 1-18 naix's or some bs,
,
they justify it saying that witht heir +/- 25 point system they can predict the winning team with some like 95% accuracy or some shit but thats all bull I can predict with 95% accuracy my expected points per game in the NBA and that number is not 0 even though in reality it is 0. MM shouldn't be made to fit variables defined as 0, or 1 for win or loss, it should be made to put equal skilled players together and vs each other.,
,
holy fuck any econometrics student could probably make a formula with the same data as valve that yields 95% expected accuracy when predicting wins/losses between teams it's not that fucking hard

						"

							its ok u have 4500+ games on 1 account over a 2 year period. u literally dont have to explain anythning. i wish i had that muhc free time in HS. unfortunately i was involved in sports and had friends so i couldnt actually play that much.,
,
even with more free time out of HS, i still cant match u. i only got 2500~ games played ,
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							holy shit how can anyone play that much dota in high school? gpa?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							""i was involved with sports"",
lol...
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							but it can be explained my concerned adult stranger,
,
here , is my recent game activity. that number is 78.1 hours, no need to lick your screen. assuming that's all playtime and no afk(it isn't), that gives us 5 hours and 30 minutes a day.,
,
now as you can see from my dotabuff, i play in streaks. binges. probably 8 or 10 hours a day. this math leaves us with  the ablitiy to binge half the days and live life the other half of the days. or it leaves the ability to binge some days, play a few other days, and live life in the rest of my time. so many possibilities! i don't actually play sports outside of a pickup soccer game, dad, because i wasnt born a frogman capable of taking down any foe. ,
,
if you're satisified, feel free to kill yourself.,
,
if you still think you're superior to me, im glad you've proved it. maybe you can sleep tonight knowing that.

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Yeah I agree with dan; there are people who have way more hours than you but are a lot worse because they have no desire to improve and just play to play. If hours were factored in it'd be extruciating both ways.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,lower but either way would be nice to have it so that it doesn't stack all the new accounts on one team. especially with the people that used the zeus exploit or bought accounts. ,
,
It doesn't have to be as strictly balanced as mmr is, but it should be a factor
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							rofl hours dont mean shit, ur ember was an acc buyer thats all.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							alright its practically impossible to go up in mmr if ur in hidden pool so im just gonna feed over 1k mmr cuz im disgusted at this matchmaking, i'll stop when im at 5k,
currently at 6.1k,
,
im nicking ""wp gameruiner"" with small letters, i'll be using a low prio bot i made so it walks down mid and just feeds and finds a match automatically,
i'll queue both us east and eu west
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							u have FUCKING ISSUES
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i gotta do this cuz this mmr is unbearable, i'll become the plague
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							have you considered just not playing matchmaking if u dont like it.  i mean i agree its bad and i try to devalue it when i can because i hate when newer plaeyrs think mmr is actually meaningful.  but some people might actually enjoy playing it and thats their thing.  itd be like if because u didnt like league of legends and thought it was stupid, u decided to make bots to make accounts and ruin LoL games.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							thats fucking hilarious actually
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							you euros. retarded bunch.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							nah lol yesterday this dumbfuck wants mid and picks TA, his opponent is storm and they're both at the same exact MMR ,
,
the storm is having connection problems for 4-6 minutes which gives TA free farm and thats basically a win right there, however the storm managed to rush bloodstone and orchid while my TA had bkb + yasha + drums around 40 minutes,
,
now lets think for a moment, why was TA in my team and not in enemy team? despite the same fucking MMR, why was storm better? the fucking storm even died 6 times with no assists or kills
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							stupid fucking mmr literally wish overwatch bans existed + quality search
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Better pull without stacking and then leech exp from carry and ask why we are losing then proceed to blame rest of team for insufficient farm.
						"

							that didnt really address wwd
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							bayonetta has once again commandeered this thread

CK ,
,
We won but CK was just talking non stop via chat & mic and micromanaging from the start. ""I guarantee a win if I play carry."" CK & Naix decided they needed to pick everyone's heroes, lanes and items. Storm randoms storm, but since Naix is a mid/carry player and support is presumably beneath him, he jungles with Naix. Had 3.5k saved up and was building a BKB, but CK & Naix insisted for 3 minutes that I buy Aghs and lecture me on the power of Aghs on Omni (it gives you global range ? wauw). I politely explain that the other team has mostly magic damage (Tide, Puck, Ogre, Slark, Doom) but they inform me that BKB is redundant because I have Repel. LoL @ 4.5k ""core players"".

game before i had a viper carry who tried to 1v2 a silencer ogre magi by diving towers before he was lvl 6 (died 3x). a couple games before that had another fucking carry viper who wouldn't teamfight utnil he had his aghs and wondered why we couldn't win against a void SF terrorblade that outfarmed us by 400cs in 35 minutes. fucking dumbfucks.

							My post was not aimed at 6ks that are forced to play with 4ks due to the lack of 5k NA dota players (which I'm sure you have to suffer through due to possibly playing on US East after being ostracized from the high 5k/6k scene in EUW). It was aimed at people who flame players that are around (+/- 200) their own MMR.

							,man that looks like the highest quality pub you'd get on a US server aside from multiple pros in the same game. I really wish they would make MMR visible @ the start so you can get a feel for the level of play you're getting. I think most of the higher rated players stick to selfish/solo heroes because they don't want to risk supporting or having to work with 4k players, so the teamwork is really minimal.

5000-5200 is new 4k i think, almost every game is like that in eu and i consider them to be very bad (some actually like to play with and vs low mmr players because its easier stomps),
,
just queue eu? 150 ms ping isnt a big issue,
also lol'd at wr getting midas but ive met this axe before, hes so bad or maybe hes trying to donate mmr a lot
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Yeah I'll see streamers playing in 6k+ games on EUW but there's definitely not as many highly rated on US servers. I'm in California so my ping to USE is already 100 and I think EUW is 200-250. I'll agree  on the sentiment that 5k is the new 4k in that a lot of ppl have figured out how to climb the ladder by picking smart/spamming but not actually improving overall.

if you add the frustration that i'm not THAT much higher than these piles of feces (99% of 4k's) then i've got a huge ass motherfucking problem

						"

							i'm going to assume some of the original 3k's are now 4k which would explain their in-game behavior/play level
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,no, i'm actually being objective as fuck. when someone is under 5k mmr or so, their teammates are pretty much always around their skill level. 4k players whining about teammates are like 5'8"" guys talking about how short other guys in the 5'7""-5'9"" range are. above 5k mmr, your teammates are actually worse than you 95% of the time, giving a legit reason to complain.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							im not saying ur wrong but im surei belong wehre im at currently.  not all players blame their teammates for their loss. im sure it happens more often between the 3-4k range but from what i've experienced so far in my bracket is that people blame less and play more which tends to lead to more wins for me at least.,
,
i remmebr when i got calibrated evertyone blamed everyone else for their own mistakes. It happens still but people tend to listen mreoand are open to suggestions
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							tho im sure 5kers have legit reason to complain because most of th etime they get matched up with 4kers who think they are better 90% of the time,

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Honestly 5k is the minimum for people to start complaining cause even the majority of 5k players are still shit. You gotta consider how people get there. If you're a 5k player from US east picking shit like slark and storm every game and feeding on noob peruvians I don't consider you a 5k player.

idc if i get matched up with 4k's i get matched with 5k's 50% of the time and they're also retarded like me so whatever,

he queues with one friend, they both WAIT until the last possible second, then he randoms and his friend picks brood and they swap. not only is he playing only brood, he's doing it with 700g per game.,

when I called him out in all chat he tried to play it off ""oh I just randomed"" then I looked at his profile and realised what he was doing,

meaning most 4k's now are former 3k's or people who don't know how to improve,

actually it's interesting since i know several people who were like 3900 when ranked came out and now they're higher than me, so yea, being 4k and not knowing how to click spells or creeps (or rather, WHEN to click) is definitely flame worthy

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							alright since everyone here takes out their e-dicks im gonna go with the flow,
i calibrated at ~4.6k (because before ranked i played pubs purely for entertainment) and im at 6k+ without spamming broken heroes except for recently spamming troll but i never thought much of mmr because i was never of the oppinion that it is an accurate representation of skill. it's not meaningless in that regard and i usually consider low 5ks and 4ks bad but the number never tells the full story and after a certain lvl its more about how you pick and/or command your allies , whether you dodge people etc. rather than how you play. i mean theres a reason a lot of the very high mmr players are not dota players but just meepo or earth spirit players. at the end of the day all the number says is how good you are at winning all pick pubs with more or less random people, it doesn't translate too well to competitive aka real dota. tier 3 or lower teams are often the home of 7k players,
i think bragging is disgusting and bragging about retarded stuff like mmr even more so, this is just in good fun tho and in all seriousness i dont consider mmr an achievement but that's just me lol i can still see why people would value it more
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"

							yeah the ending was a bit reddit-esque dunno why, its 5 am here i can't word earnest posts right now
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I mean before mmr people were judged by winrate or even more useless stuff. Right now mmr is the most reliable indicator of dota play. Doesnt mean its very reliable but thats the reasoning why so many people value it highly
						"

						"

if u skip it to do a stack then when the stack is done you should have it.,

they also refused to 1st or 2nd pick and our entire team lost 30-50 gold

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i just had a medusa who took 32 minutes to farm phase linkens manta then he proceeded to buy a skadi so he had next to 0 damage output,
,
towards the end of the game, there was a point where we sat around for 4 minutes even though i asked him multiple times to go forward and bait so our enigma could black hole - i would have gone and splitpushed, but both side barracks were already dead, and i had no way of dealing with sniper,
,
later on, both medusa and i brought back,
medusa decided to die, buyback, FAIL TO KILL SNIPER DESPITE BEING ABLE TO AUTOATTACK HIM WHILE HE WAS ON 100 HEALTH, then die again,
needless to say we lost ,

this game has made want to quit dota,

							,Radiance doesn't seem like the build, though
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							what would you suggest in its place?,
i figured that radiance would give us some much needed counterpush/general push as well as dealing nice damage to zeus, puck and disruptor,
i usually buy MKB on her, but i decided to try radiance this game because of the above reason. most of the games i play brood im put up against PA or some other evasive hero
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I mean Radi's not bad vs. the Puck but if he's good at timing it won't burn him fast enough to cancel blink after Euls/ Phase. Against that lineup I'd probably get a Blink early on over Radi. A Bfly for the crit first sniper is good here, Manta isn't bad, Blink Sheep would wreck the Sniper and Puck, Eblade is generally useful on Brood, and it's 40 agi. I don't get it on Brood much, but Necro 3 is also a good choice here probably if you wanted that early push you mentioned. Your other items are fine though

did he fall off to like 3k or something
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,no thats me
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,thanks dude, re the specific suggestions,
,
butterfly - i like this as an early pickup and was actually going to buy it, but my friend (OD) convinced me not to due to headshot procs as well as sniper's ability as an MKB carrier,
blink - i was considering buying this towards the end so i could blink abyssal the sniper, but i didnt end up doing this because buyback gold. maybe i should have gone basher blink rather than abyssal nothing,
manta - i think manta is a good item, but im not sure about it against sniper due to self blocking with illusions, also there wasnt too much to manta out of (?),
eblade - thats an interesting idea, but most of the time i find brood is most effective as an autoattacker. do you mainly get it for the agi boost then to eblade -> spiders for the last 700 damage or something?,
necro3 - i do like this item, but i feel as though it causes to drop off at about 30 minutes and struggle to do stuff at this point due to the large investment,
sheepstick - i think this item could be effective and would like to try it in the future.  better seeming than orchid

						"

Really? That's your argument? n=1, so something must be missing? Meanwhile, you left out, oh, every possible detail about your playstyle and how that fits in with the report algorithm. ,
,
Maybe you are just an average player, making yourself less of a target for reports. Maybe you don't use a microphone. Maybe you don't play enough games to reach the report threshold. Maybe you don't engage bad players. Maybe you don't communicate at all. ,
,
Get back to us when you play ten games per day, everyday. And use a microphone. And carry, hard. And freely call out stupid teammates after they repeatedly ignore fair advice. Because I guarantee you do none of those things consistently. If you did, you would be muted and in LP like the rest of us. Because the report system is trash. ,
,
Here's how the mute system works: get muted by trash tier scrubs. Then for the next week, have to listen to similar trash tier scrubs run their mouth with no way to correct them. ,
,
I use the chat wheel ""we need wards"". Idiot support buys standard wards, when we needed sentry wards for invisible units and counter warding. Repeatedly spam ""we need wards"". I get reported. I (carry), start buying all the sentry wards. Then they start complaining why I'm behind on my items. Literally the stupidest fucking low IQ trash teammates imaginable. ,
,
Trash tier scrub telling me my items are wrong? Can't debate it, because Valve decided to censor me. Free speech? Nope, not in Valve's nazi steam environment. ,
,
Not a single intelligent person can justify this report system. It causes undue psychological stress (unequal treatment, unable to communicate) and it degrades the game for the other nine people in the proceeding dozens of games the muted player goes on to play (lack of communication). Guess how many times I get asked ""if I'm going mid"" at the hero picks? Every game. Can't respond, because Valve censored me. ,
,
Not only that, but by muting people, Valve is making a decision FOR YOU. Valve is telling YOU who you get to hear, and who you don't get to hear. None if you shit brain gamers have a problem with that? Really? You are all that dumbed down? Sitting in your shitty homes and apartments, playing shitty games because your life sucks, not educating yourself about the pitfalls of censorship? Do you fucking losers read books, or do you just sit in class playing with your cellphone that your mommy bought you? ,
,
You brain dead morons. This is why esports is an absolute joke. None of you represent humankind. You are utterly devoid of any attractive qualities. You are weak skinny junk food eating assholes. The losers from Asia don't even qualify as human. Calling them robots does an actual disservice to robots. Zombies is a better term. ,
,
Eat shit and die. You are wrong, and you will be faced with that conclusion before your time is up on this shitty planet. Hopefully sooner, than later, so you can then suffer the rest of your days knowing what a pathetic sack of stupid shit you really are, turning to even greater amounts of stimulants in your life to try and stave off the deression that will eventually consume you. ,
,
Don't bother responding with any of your low IQ dribble, I never return to converse with STUPID people. Pray I don't decide to charge you a fee for the time I spent educating you about your own stupidity. I doubt you could afford to pay it.

title default,link default,user default,"
							if there's anything this change to rmm (where highest mmr/avg mmr per team is visible) has shown me, it's that,
,
- i win close to 75% of my matches when the avg mmr is 5300+,
- i lose almost every match when the avg is below 5000,
- showing the avg/highest mmr doesn't do anything to change the behavior of delusional retards, they will still insist on going mid (i'm not a mid player and will rarely play a mid/snowball hero, i also don't pick sniper/troll/axe/lina either) ,
,
playing with/even seeing low skill trash on my team who just sit in their lane as pos 3-5 and do nothing useful puts me on mega tilt, it's such a shame my ping to eu west isn't lower cuz games tend to be more enjoyable (not necessarily easier but u get way fewer losses that aren't ur fault at all) and u can expect people to at least have a rough idea of what to do to win a game

u should try queuing during daytime and cancelling queue every 2 min so u get low 5k players instead of 4k ones (valve apparently re-enabled the mmr range = search time correlation factor) since the latter are insufferable most of the time. it won't guarantee a win of course...but you're far less likely to get 4 monkeys who escaped from the zoo

							Hello,,
,
I would like to make a report against 2 players who has severely insulted me in game and 1 of them actually abused keeper of the light ability (Recall). At the start of the game they have been asking me to pick the heroes they want, but I didn't cause we were playing Captains Mode. Captains are the one who chooses the suitable heroes for the players from what I know. So they threatened to report me and insulted me in the game. Due to keeper of the light abusing his ability(Recall) trapping me inside trees, I have been removed from the game due to inactivity and will be assessed with an abandon. As a result I lost my MMR. But I still played throughout the end even though they insulted me, ability abusing and losing my MMR. The match ID is 1397551072. The names of both of them are ""Dr.Game Is Paused"" and ""SMJ.CURVE"". You can actually refer to the match ID for the replay. I hope you could give them a severe punishment and not some low priority games because I felt very agitated and severely insulted but I tried to kept my calm inside the game as you can see the replay. The replay speaks for itself. For anymore information, feel free to ask me. I was using Earth Shaker.,

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							sure but I'm pretty sure that the majority of 4k is comprised of people who believe that picking troll and the likes is healthy for their skill development which in turn makes the next mmr tier weaker in terms of diversity.

Also, if you're playing in the <4.5k bracket, don't fucking post here. There's tens of thousands of players in the 3-4k pool, no one runs into them enough to warrant them being posted here, and no one gives a fuck about them because you can assume all <4.5k players are objectively shitters.

							supports are by far relatively worst players in ranked. 75% of 5k + supports have no idea how to play a safelane, they just alternate between standing perfectly still in the trees taking exp and single pulling. If mid players were as bad at the laning stage as support players itd just be two heroes autoattacking the creepwave. I bet half the supports above 5k just got there by having a positive attitude and motivating their team or some shit. FUck them

There's a kid at my school that looks exactly like eternal envy. He wears anime shirts every day and renenacts anime battle scenes from naruto or some other shit in front of random people,
,
Whenever I see him I imagine EE from an alternate universe who never got to play dota 2 and that's what he became,

I just want someone to confirm that he strongly resembles EE so I don't have to feel crazy anymore, but I can't take a pic of him because that's mean

Can any Meepo players confirm or deny
						"

							Also there's an influx of disgusting Naga Ocore pickers in my games and I hate it,
,
Hope either Naga or Ocore gets nerfed
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							naga ocore sucks at this mmr, bc the more u farm and push all the lanes in the more ur teammates get twitchy and start feeding
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							tell them to jungle or rosh or something I dunno, honestly after you get those two items on Naga if you don't suck at her and don't panic and die without buyback somehow, you just win the game by 40
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							can someone briefly explain how that items good on naga i dont see it besides the cd reductions or is that it,
,
do illusion lifesteal go directly to the main or something?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							100% uptime on illusions,
45s CD on song,
Illusions lifesteal the radiance damage,
Good stats for the hero
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							does illusion lifesteal go to the main hero yes or no?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							You have 0 downtime on your Q illusions, you push out lanes and exert pressure on the other team even more with it, and get items even faster after that thanks to more illusions and lower E cooldown,
,
Also you and the illusions benefit from the Radiance burn heal and E heal to some extent, which is good since the item basically replaces Heart in terms of items Naga would get previous to Ocore being in the game,
,
Also 30 second BoTs, and like a 6 second downtime on Manta as opposed to the normal 15 second downtime without Ocore
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							No,
The main hero gets lifesteal from her own  radiance though I think?,
But the illusion's damage does not heal the main hero, no.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,No it goes to them, but if you E and your illusion hits a hero with the E, that heal goes to main hero
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							oh fuck that shit affects items too wtrf,
,
,ah
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,yeah dude shits broke,
dont tell people though, there was a period where people would midas rush into first item ocore and I dont want that back those teammates were the fucking worst
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							octa core is pretty good when naga is in a 4 protect one,
,
but usually heart + bts + manta + radiance + aquila is enough to close out the game in pubs at this level for me

LOL WHAT
						"

							,thats a 35% storm winrate i hope ur ok mentally after that experience
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
Usually my rule of thumb is blink first if you're winning and aghs first if your team is behind but it depends on the game such as if the enemy is split pushing and has gankable heroes
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							aghs is usually first because it increases your farm and also your clones dont die as easily,
,
boots + upgrade + aghs + blink,
,
some people get blink before aghs if the other team is just a bunch of feeders
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Why would you go blink first when ur team is winning tho. If lanes are looking good, getting Aghs before 14min imho is really good. You'll get the 2250 gold for dagger in no time with aghs meepo anyways. I wouldnt risk getting dagger first thats when shit happens like ur getting ganked after laning phase and stuff.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							rly the only reason ppl get dagger first is to have fun,
,
if the other team is filled with monkeys there is no reason to actually try

storm shits on bs, but only if bs is the only good player on the other team and he has no support.  tinker sucks against bs and always has, unless you do the glimmer cape gimmick, which if you're pulling off you already won your tinker game congrats.  most of you pubstars would just pick wr and get stupid shackles that make no sense after following an 800 ms bs, but it works sometimes since getting him to sit still for that long is all it usually takes for the kill.,

							ARTEEZY. Holy fuck this kiddie throws all his fucking matches if his team doesn't suck his dick 24/7. I had a match where I was support dazzle and even though I was needed bot lane, I carried a tp and used it multiple times to try and help him (enemy team basically trilaned mid cuz it was rtz mid as lina) he just fuckin babyraged and decided to drop his items and chainfeed when it was only like 15 minutes into the game.,
,
Here's the dotabuff, but it doesnt mean shit because its the end game stats, after the courier feeding, after arteezy walking in 10 times and dying, after my team copying him like fanboy retards and also selling their items (tbh the game is over when ur best player and mid player drops his items and gives up, but still) ,
,
Lina was basically matching the Leshrac farmwise even with leshrac needed 2 people to babysit him mid. Bloodseeker had his own thing going on but volunteered to watch over mid to help lina in case they dived, which they did ALOT. and he got return kills.,
,
The match wasn't even extremely spread MMR-wise, Avg MMR was like 5.3k, he was on his smurf which was like 5.5k, I was 5.2k at the time (now 5.4k) and he cant win with an account that basically puts him on easy mode?,
,
(Seriously though, has anyone else watching rtzs stream noticed he is babyraging out of games alot more than usual?),
,
I would recommend dodging if you get arteezy in your team, and also eternalenvy (but only if he is playing one of his ""experimental"" heroes. Remember his tinker adventures? when he lost to a wisp that went MoM daedalus armlet...)
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							im saying it because it seems impossible to me that someone that bad got to 7k mmr without cheating.  also i've heard several rumors that he exploited in a couple different ways to gain mmr.,
,
most 7k players are good at pubstomp heroes.  for example, if you watch them play those heroes, they are good at them and they frequently play well and contribute to their team's chance to win.  even if you think they are shitty in other departments, they are quite good at storm naga pl etc.  picsleader sucks ass at storm and sf and qop, he's objectively bad at those heroes and i've seen high 4k players play them better than he does.
						"

							,have u ever considered that he's one of the best dota players in the world and u suck ass and maybe u need to improve u stupid fucking mong
						"

							Oh yeah one more thing. Does anyone know who Mikey is? He is like 6.2k but I've never seen his name and all the matches I have been with him, he did really poorly and we kinda steamrolled him easily.
						"

							,This thread is about ""the worst players u can get in ranked"", not the worst players in dota, you fucking made the title yourself idiot,
,
im sharing the fact that arteezy is not someone you want on your team in ranked all pick. obviouslyt hes fucking good when he tries, but hes on this spree of disabling match sharing on his main etc and then switching accs everytime he gets reported for intentionally feeding which he literally does on stream if his team does something he doesnt like.

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I mean.... you just said Arteezy is one of the worst player to get in your pubs. Just let that sink in. He's ~7.3k, some of the best map awareness, mechanics, and decision making in DotA, can play literally ANY core hero better than you 100% of the time in any environment, probably ,hero in general TBH, and you're flaming him? Cause he tilted and Kappachino BabyRaged for his stream or whatever and didn't play well in a few of your games? If you're being unironic, you really should think about what you said over a nice bottle of Kleenex.

						"

						"

							,How do people that arent friends with ixmike and other people in charge of fpl get in? Arteezy offered me a vouch to fpl if I abandoned that dazzle game but I hsd already had my soul devastated by him lnce. Seeing him feed and give up was like finding out your childhood hero got drunk and ran naked in the streets trhough the news,

,
I fucking used my charm on that match man
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I don't know how i'm defending someone who says rtz is one of the worst players in the game but he has a point, playing with rtz or ee on your team while they're streaming is actually awful. They get camped a ton and everyone does stupid shit to try to impress them or shut them down or whatever. The game just turns to shit, it's not even dota. I don't blame rtz for raging. Getting people just running at you for the first 20 minutes of the game isn't fun. Even if they run at you and feed under your tower (which happens a lot because they're bad players) it's not much fun because it's just so clowny and stupid. This doesn't only happen with rtz, it seems like the higher the average mmr the game is the worse it's going to be. I groan a little inside whenever I get in a game with a high average mmr. That's just the way matchmaking works. A game with a giant skill differential is always going to filled with stupid shit. Valve honestly needs to implement some kind of inhouse league ladder type thing for the top players. It's only going to get worse as more and more people play the game and get really high mmr.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Well if he's 7.3k that makes it pretty likely that your team will be low mmr with a 7k vs a bunch of 5/6k mmrs on the other team so I guess he is bad to have on your team #/r/theydidthemath elegiggle
						"

							Hey guys, I'm a high 5k player that's been doing account boosting/coaching for a while now. Here is a small example of my work. I strongly believe that anyone can climb up to 4k with just a little bit of effort. In 5k+ games everyone is quite efficient and solid mechanically. Having an edge over your opponents comes down to complex, non-concrete factors, such as positioning, teamwork, and decision making. On the other hand, in games up to 4k you can easily be the best player in the game if you just understand a few simple tips and tricks. I've decided to compile some of the biggest misconceptions and mistakes I see from 2k and 3k players. Hopefully this helps some of you guys escape the ""trench"" and move on to 4k and beyond. These are in no particular order so I'd recommend you read all of them as they are all useful.,
 ,
1) Playing support too often.,
This doesn't mean you should last pick Spectre when your team already has 4 cores. However, you shouldn't play support in the majority of your solo games if your goal is to increase in MMR. I've played with/against supports in games as low as 2.5k who bought courier + wards + shared tangos, used their spells correctly, and gave a big advantage to their mid/safelanes. Unfortunately, the cores on their team would fail miserably and would get no farm and have no impact on the game, leaving the support player with an almost guaranteed loss.If you insist on playing support, make sure you get enough farm and pick a hero that can still have lategame impact, such as Visage or Naga. NOTE: I'm not trying to say you can't climb MMR by playing support because that's not true. You can definitely have a great winrate playing support, but it'll be harder than if you played solid cores every game.,
 ,
2) Not understanding that it is not mid's responsiblity to gank.,
When I smurf games I mostly play mid solo. My biggest fear is getting a matchup which I can't completely dominate. My goal is to completely crush my opponent and snowball from there. If I play against something like an OD or Zeus and all I can do is trade farm, this is a big problem for me. Fortunately, most mids in these games make the mistake of being inefficient and leaving the lane far too early. There was a game I played Tinker vs Zeus, a matchup where neither of us could really deny eachother but we could each get almost every last hit. We also couldn't kill eachother without support rotations. If the Zeus just stayed in the lane, bought Bottle/Arcanes/Soulring, and got 4 CS every wave I wouldn't be able to get a big advantage early. However, he decided to leave the lane at level 4 with no boots to roam with his 290 movespeed. He got one kill in 3 minutes and by the time he came back mid I was 2 levels and at least 20 CS ahead of him. From then on I just farmed lane/jungle constantly, got 12 minute BoT + SR+ Blink and took over the game. Let's take a look some of the things that happen if you try to gank too early:,
 ,
• You miss a ton of crucial early gold and solo exp from the lane. Unless you somehow manage to somehow net a first blood or double kill, your gank simply won't be worth it in terms of gold or experience.,
• You walk through wards. Most supports ward the runes at the start of the game. For the first 7 minutes, the enemy will have full vision of your rotations and the gank will likely fail.,
• You let the enemy mid push freely. Not only do you risk losing a crucial tower, it also becomes abundantly clear you're trying to gank when you have a whole creepwave pounding on your T1 and you're nowhere to be seen.,
• You aren't strong enough compared to the enemy sidelane. If you leave the lane at level 4 while the enemy is level 2, you don't really have a huge edge over them. However, if you leave at level 7 while the enemy is level 4, you have an ultimate and a maxed out spell which is much more impactful.,
In most cases, it's actually better for your team to rotate mid and gank for you. If you are going to gank as the mid laner, only do it in beneificial situations. For example, finding a haste or invis rune or getting a good TP opportunity when the enemy is diving your team's T1.Keep in mind that losing your mid T1 tower is a HUGE deal, so try not to leave the lane for more than 2 minutes at a time if you don't have anyone who can take over mid and defend a push.,
 ,
3) Thinking missing calls are a substitute for wards.,
Calling missing is so outdated and is practically useless if you don't have vision around the map. You can say the enemy mid laner is missing, but then what? He could be going to the offlane, to the safelane, or to the jungle. Are all your heroes just going to stop farming for a whole minute until the mid laner shows himself again? Wards are extremely cheap now and can be bought one at a time. There is no excuse to not have wards up in the early game. At the 7 minute mark, supports should place 1 ward at the safelane rune to spot ganks, and another on the mid highground to help their mid laner. If you're playing mid and your supports don't ward, buy at least one of your own and do it for them. It is well worth the investment.,
 ,
4) Terrible courier usage.,
Have you ever been playing safe/offlane and just REALLY wanted your magic wand about 2 minutes in but you needed a circlet to complete it? If you're that guy that sends a walking courier on an expedition around the world to get a 200 gold item that won't even help you that much in lane, STOP IT IMMEDIATELY. Your mid lane often gets his bottle around 1:30-2:30. If you're using the courier for some dumb item at this timing, you can straight up lose your mid the lane. As a sidelaner, you should itemize at the start of the game so that you can buy most of the things you need from the side shop. A good mid that's farming well and dominating his lane will need the courier almost constantly. Please wait at least until 3 minutes when the courier is flying to get your Aquila, Wand, or whatever other minor item you really need. And for God's sake, never, EVER send the walking courier to your safelane to deliver you brown boots or some other item which you could easily just buy in the side shop.,
On another note, I see people just not using the courier at all when they should. They will leave crucial items in their stash because they're too lazy to micro the courier. Get used to using your courier hotkeys. Courier usage and bottle crowing are a crucial part of Dota. If it helps you, use a cfg macro to control the most useful courier functions. For example, I use this:,
//Courier,
alias ""courier_burst"" ""dota_select_courier;dota_ability_execute 5;+dota_camera_follow;"",
alias ""courier_deliver"" ""dota_purchase_quickbuy;dota_courier_deliver;+dota  _camera_follow;"",
,
alias ""rightclick"" ""+sixense_right_click;-sixense_right_click"",
alias ""+bottle"" ""dota_select_courier; dota_stop; +sixense_left_shift;"",
alias ""-bottle"" ""dota_select_courier; dota_ability_execute 5;dota_ability_execute 0;dota_ability_execute 3; dota_ability_execute 4;-sixense_left_shift;"",
,
bind ""F2"" ""courier_deliver"",
bind ""F3"" ""+bottle;"",
bind ""F4"" ""courier_burst"",
 ,
5) Not farming efficiently enough.,
This is by far one of the most crucial reasons why players stay 2k/3k. The map has a limited amount of resources. It is your responsibility as a 1/2 position player to take advantage of those. No matter how good a team is, they're going to have trouble fighting against someone with twice their net worth. If you're playing safelane against an easy offlaner, you should not be missing any CS, even under tower. You should also farm the jungle whenever possible. A similar concept applies to mid. Once you get your bottle + arcanes and/or soul ring, you should be pushing out the waves, then heading to the jungle to stack/farm before going back to kill the next creep wave. For instance, the mid creep wave reaches the ramp at around x:40. You can kill this wave in about 3 seconds with a hero like Lesh/Lina, get every last hit, then go for rune and STILL have time to farm 1-2 camps in jungle before the next creep wave is ready to be farmed. I rarely see anyone do this and it's the main reason why I never lose mid in these games.,
For example, here is a game where I helped my team get some kills but my main focus was on farming. By 10 minutes I pushed the enemy mid tower then started pushing every wave and farming jungle whenever I had spare time. On the contrary, the enemy Slark mid had 13 (?!) CS since he was trying to gank constantly. This is simply unacceptable. Even though Slark is not a great mid against Tinker, getting barely 1cs/min is horrendous. He could easily have counter pushed the waves with Dark Pact and had at the bare minimum 40 cs by this point. By just leaving the lane and giving me a free lane/jungle, he let me snowball in farm. Before 14 minutes, I was able to hit 100 cs and get my blink dagger while he managed to only get 4 more creeps. Needless to say, the game was quite a stomp from that point on.,
Here are a few basic tips for increasing your farming efficiency at mid. Lots of these apply to safelane as well:,
 ,
• Treads switch. Put your treads on Strength when casting Soul Ring, Intelligence when using spells, and Agility when using Bottle to regen.,
• If you have Soul Ring and Arcanes, drop your Arcanes before using Soul Ring. This will give you around +200 to temporary mana rather than 150, which is often enough to nuke an entire wave at basically no mana cost at all.,
• If you're in a safe position (in jungle, behind t1, etc.) drop +stats items (null tali, point booster) before using bottle charges. This will help you regen more hp/mana per charge.,
• Bottle crow. If your bottle is empty, no rune is spawning for a long time, and the courier isn't in use, send the courier to your hero but DO NOT SPEED BURST. Put your bottle on the courier, use speed burst, send it back to base and shift-queue for it to deliver items. This way you can keep your mana and hp up constantly for farming safely.,
• Mid creep waves reach the enemy high ground near T1 at around 10 / 40 seconds past the minute. If you anticipate this you can March/Raze/any other nuke in fog and push the wave that much faster.,
• Rotate to jungle when the enemy lane creeps aren't in danger of dying any time soon to your tower/creeps. Don't just stand mid waiting for the next wave or attempting pointless rotations that have almost no chance of working. Farming 2 jungle camps (especially if they are stacked) is worth a ton of gold/exp.,
 ,
6) Bad itemization / skill builds.,
I can't give examples for every scenario here but you should try to build your hero in an optimal fashion every game. For instance, if you're playing Luna safelane and the enemy has 5 stuns, don't do something stupid like rush Butterfly just because you're having a good early game. Buy a BKB and make sure you can teamfight effectively rather than taking unnecessary risks. Similarly, don't do horrible skill builds like maxing mana break / spell shield early on AM. Watch pro replays / streams and see how they build heroes. There's a reason lots of builds are the standard, and that's because they're the most efficient. Don't try to be different/cute by getting horrible items, especially if your team is relying on you to carry teamfights.,
 ,
7) Bad spell useage,
If you're playing Tide/Enigma or some similar initaitor with a long CD ulti, don't hold on to it waiting to catch 5 people. Solo black hole on a core is perfectly fine, and is in fact better than waiting for the perfect scenario which may never occur. You don't want to have your spells off cooldown all the time. On the contary, if you're playing something like Lina/Lion/AM don't use your ultis just to KS a support who is 100% going to die anyway. Use it for someone else in a teamfight to ensure you get more kills. Remember, it matters very little who gets the last hit. It's more important to secure kills and use spells optimally than waiting to KS.,
 ,
8) Thinking you need a tank/hard carry every game.,
First off, this isn't World of Warcraft and you aren't looking to do a raid on Ragnoros. I can build Bristleback with no boots and 6 hearts but unfortunately my opponents aren't AI and they can just ignore me and kill the rest of my team. It's nice to have tanky heroes, but it's not a necessity. Don't pick Axe when you already have a jungler/offlane just because you need a ""tank"". Similarly, hard carries are not necessary in most games and in fact are quite game losing in this meta. It's nice to have some late game, but don't last pick Spectre and go offlane when you already have a safelane Clinkz just because you ""need HC"". Laning stage is super important in Dota. If you completely lose your lane because you picked a HC, you're basically going to be useless for the next 30 minutes. Sure, a team like LC/Spec/SF/Clinkz/NP is terrific late game when everyone is 6 slotted but how on earth are you going to win your lanes and all get farm? It's almost always better to have 2 supports, 2 cores that get farm priority, and 1 core that makes space than to be really greedy and go for ultra lategame 6 slotted lineups.,
 ,
9) Bad attitude / flaming.,
Not every game is going to go your way. Don't get upset and start flaming the minute one thing goes wrong. Remember, you are not playing against Team Secret. Even if your team makes a lot of mistakes, the enemy team is also full of bad players. Many times someone gives up and starts ruining the game directly or indirectly when they still have a good chance of winning. If your team makes a mistake, don't yell at them for it. They probably already know they did something wrong, there's no need to remind them. You can give friendly advice but for the most part you should focus on your own game.,
If you have a team full of cancerous team mates that won't shut up, just ignore all chat. You can still communicate via chat wheel / voice but you no longer have to see all the ""cyka blyat fuck your mother"" that goes on. Remind your team to stay positive and cooperate with eachother, but never let a toxic teammate distract you from playing your best. The mute function is very useful and exists for a reason.

							I think it's very important for Valve to make the decision and stamp down on excessive player movement after TI and impose some form of restrictions. It's going to be beneficial to have rules on player transfers to ensure that the scene can remain as balanced as possible. If you allow free movement of top tier players, you're making it possible for a really top heavy competition, without much chance for the mid to lower tier teams.
						"

						"

							Not only that, whit 2 permanent stand-ins, the team may have differents play-styles accoording to the oponent you face.,

you want an early game, ganking base team vs team B, you put your back-up mid player.
						"

							If transfers are limited they will think twice about their lineup and they will learn how to cope with issues. In the end they will get more experienced, because you only get stronger when you face your problems - and not by avoiding them by kicking someone out of a team and replacing him/her.

							It is TI5 grand finals, Secret vs C9. After 4 intense games, it is tied up at 2-2. All these chinese teams have been knocked out due to the meta change. Jacky had bleached his hair for this TI in preparation for what is to come.,
Jacky closed his eyes and said, ""It is time Bone-chan"". He then opens his eyes with the fury of a thousand suns, he picked on Leshrac, Beastmaster, Phoenix, Crystal maiden and Kotl. He has prepared this strategy since the legendary ""6.84 patch day of doom"".,
He all-chats: ""Artour, you have yet to see my final form."" Artour replies: ""LMAO wHo cARES HAHA Xd"",
EE farmed up Bloodstone, Loda's Orb, Octarine Core in 20 minutes on Leshrac and have taken their middle barracks. Jacky knows it, Artour knows it, the world knows it. It is time. It is time for the greatest spirit bomb that Dota2 has ever seen.,
C9 begins to push through middle line with 10 full couriers of enchanted mango. They are ready to finish the game. Jacky stands up in his booth as he blinks into the Secret base with his ultimate and Diabolic Edict turn on. "". FEED ME MANGOES, FEED ME MANGOES, FEED ME MANGOES, FEED ME MANGOES, yells Jacky. Phoenix casts Supernova, Kotl is channeling his wave of heal, CM channeling freezing field, BM roars onto Arteezy's OD.,
Secret cannot handle this death ball that Jacky has become. Artour's eyes are now glowing in fear. ""We cannot... we cannot go near him... His power level is just... We fucking lost"". Artour instantly purchases a second Midas and has given up. Puppey yelled at Artour to sell his midas and knocked some sense into him. Secret has decided to go for the couriers and support kills instead. So smart... So Smart...,
The throne is now down to 200 hp, only Bone7 and EE is alive and both of them are on low on HP. Looking like a lifeless and dried up flower, Johan breathlessly says, ""We are out of mangoes Jacky...you have drained all our energy..."" ""Just a little bit more..."", Jacky whispers. Bigdaddy, FATA- and Misery have all fainted in their seats as they are all out of energy.,
""Bone-chan, all these throws you have committed over the years, it is time for me to cleanse your sins..."", EE uses his bloodstone and commits suicide, he sacrificed himself for Bone322's sins. Bone is now full life. Standing ovation from the crowd, LD has gone insane and repeatedly yells, ""WAOWWWWW!!! THE SUICIDE, THE SUICIDE"". Bone's last few auto attacks finishes off the throne as he also faints. Jacky exits the booth, Secret is in disbelief, Artour is in BabyRage mode. It is over. Jacky walks out of his booth and rips the Aegis of Immortal out of GabeN's hands. Jacky walks up to Ar1se and smashes him in the head with the aegis. It is over... TI5... the last International, the greatest Esport tournament ever.

							? you can dodge if he's targetting you..
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Aite imma make a video showing how you can dodge lesh E as puck just like you can dodge lion ult or lina ult
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							The lightning hits the initial target after the 0.25 second effect delay and then jumps to other targets in 0.25 second intervals, so hitting all target takes 2/2.25/2.5/2.75 seconds.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Because of the effect delay, the initial lightning can be avoided with spell immunity, invulnerability or becoming hidden. However, this does not prevent it from jumping.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Lesh's lightning can be dodged with phase shift if it's casted on you.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							how do u dodge bolt with phase shift,
,
I thought it just didn't go off if u try to shift it
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Nevermind I'm dumb. What a player.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Seems to me that Zeus' Lightning Bolt can only be Phase Shifted if he targets it to the ground.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							No if u phase shift he casts it to the ground you gotta time it properly and its really hard lol
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							so u have to shift it as he casts it LOL,
,
welp
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yea i aint ever seen a puck do that
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I tested it earlier, if he targets Puck and he Phases then Zeus just stops, the spell doesn't get casted.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i actually find laguna to be pretty easy to phase shift dodge. idk about zeus's i think he has a shorter casting time or w/e but nice to know that u can dodge zeus and lesh, didint know that
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							There's a very short delay before Laguna hits and you're dead, so it's much easier to dodge with fire remnant and stuff
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I had a puck dodge like 7 of my Laguna blades one game. Lost that one
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
u can only dodge it if he casts it on the ground initially

							nice i got kyxy and kecik on my team
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,theres a very long cast animation thats easy to time
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							hows fire remnant any easier than phase shift you just click one button and its instant. as a matter of fact dont you have to be facing the direction of the remnant to go to it? that would make it slower than phase shift
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,kill yourself
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							it's d + click while puck is just e,
,
You could smartcast but the clicking makes it longer

purple was calling me 5k trash what does that even mean his name was mark57,

							my boy Damascus,
,
,
,
i can safely say that im a connoisseur when it comes to Damascus,
,
im amazed by his ability to sometimes get carried by 4k players,
,
his strategies have no equal, sometimes he picks a hero that can kill without any farm whatsoever (ursa) so that it doesnt matter that he gets rekt in lane every game by 4ks, he can still 1 shot the enemy important hero,
,
other times he picks a hero that will dominate his lane no matter what (last pick huskar) and proceeds to spam burning spears on the enemy hero. he might miss every last hit but in the end it doesnt matter, he has faith in his 4k players to win for him,
,
its certainly a wonderful ability i must say. with these kind of strategies it doesnt matter that he sucks ass, he will just spam games and have a possitive winrate thus raising the rating that doesnt mean shit.
						"

							,I think it's because most of the time the farm is better on the 6+k players if their impact on the game benefits from having more farm.,

Add to that the ""unique"" neurological wiring required to maintain such an mmr and the types of players you get on your team on a normal basis on na servers and such outbursts should be of no surprise to anyone.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							no, it's because the majority of them aren't really 6.5k+ skilled, it's just theyve picked the meme heroes of this patch like leshrac/qop/ta/storm/tusk which are really powerful and conducive to rapid mmr gain. So when they face adversity or actually strong competition instead of a typical borderline 5k mmr player matched up with them, they begin to panic and fling shit like untrained apes. see: justin dota, ritsu, Lin, etc.

we were actually up 8 or 9 kills with 1-2 deaths in the first 5 mins then this mexican bloodseeker starts saying report bh for some reason and then bh has a mental breakdown and feeds himself and buys couriers the rest of the game, even as this is happening me and storm are destroying the entire enemy team but they eventually just accumulate so much gold from those 2 feeding we cant do anything anymore and its practically a 2v6, our omni was afk standing in jungle camps for half the game,

							fairly sure you can determine match quality for most games by determining if your team has less peruvians, twitter handles, hashtags, meme-related names, twitch links than the opposing team,

then this 5.4k thinks hes so much better than other 5.2k players and picks necro to afk jungle because he didnt get a lane(it turned out okay so w/e) and this phx who called support last pick decides to abandon pl to steal my farm bot and i had to buy wards the whole game and gank people at level4 the fuck.,

I don't know if it's just me or if there's something about them that makes them good for pubs. I guess it's at least partially because AA can help globally with ult and disruptor punishes bad positioning, which you see a lot in pubs.

							I think I got cursed with really bad ES players or something recently,

literally every game with ES on my team in the past few days misses fissures (THEYRE NOT FUCKING SKILL SHOTS JUST POINT AND CLICK HOLY FUCK) and basically plays at a 2k level
						"

							why does every peruvian have no clue when to pick their bloodseeker/huskar/whatever and then suck total ass at it
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							my bloodseekers always try to jungle against bounty hunters and then do nothing all game
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Sounds like my jungle Axes vs Bloodseeker. Or that one time there was a Techies on my team spamming Soul Ring at 100hp giving the enemy BS free MS and DMG so that he could just rape the lane all early game.
						"

							why do people like kermit d frogg even flame in ranked,

picks slark into undying bounty leshrac and bloodseeker goes shadowblade first and then pings everyone else and feels the need to use his microphone

						"

						"

							last picking huskar is a good bet too,

i got out of low priority and then my internet went out so back to lpq i go
						"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Your choice I guess. I decided to stick with the normal rmm cancer rather than the fplq cancer. You can still get vouched on fpl if good players see you play well on rmm and imo thats way better than having to play fplq.

3 people from this game,

dark green went offlane ember spirit and ended up with a 40 minute battlefury manta or some shit, was deadweight all game and then had the audacity to blame everyone who carried him early game for ""losing their streaks"" as if that's not completely inevitable and supposed to necessitate the people who had all the space to get items to HAVE FUCKING ITEMS,
,
teal went like 0-4 mid then when his team started winning started typing your typical awful player who manages to win a game shit like ""ez mid"" (he went like 0-5 mid or something) and was flaming in all chat and i'm super bitter this guy was able to win this game there's no fucking way i'd want him on my team,
,
blue wrote ""the dives"" at the end like the kind of player who thinks his one liner can sum up why a winning team began losing even though he sucks shit and what's worse is i had him friendlisted before this game so avoid him too
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							wow i'm actually so fucking mad so much about that game was stupid as fuck,

also i forgot to mention that i literally had to tell the support bh to stop standing behind me trying to help deny vs a potm and that he should just roam but at least he listened
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							the game before i get a silencer and earthspirit who have no idea how to play and keep running in and suiciding and asking me why im not there.  the few times there was an actual chance for a good fight, the silencer would suicide then ping me as if i was supposed to initiate as a juggernaut with only boots/MoM vs a wyvern ta team.  then they flamed me really hard for going BoTs as if there was some fighting item i could build after their suicidng.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							a few games earlier im a pudge offlane doing reasonably well but the spirit breaker keeps coming into my lane and saying retarded shit like ""i need to get lvl 2"" ""why didnt u ult him"" (my ult is cd and wouldnt do anything anyway) and suicide charging into a 1000 hp bloodseeker behind their tower and then asking me why i didnt come with him (im like a lvl 4 pudge and hes a lvl 2 sb).  At some point the AA also tped into my lane randomly and just tried to hit them alone and suicided into their bloodseeker.,
,
the game after, i get a glimmer cape mid lina who just runs around doing absolutely nothing all game except occasionally coming into my lane and nuking my creeps and midgame she blames me for not carrying.  the other 3 players were also very very bad, particularly the aa who would literally just sit behind me and try to deny every single creep in an empty lane for 5 min and he often would mess up and then hit a creep and fuck up my last hit.  at least those 3 players didnt type stuff tho.  ,
,
actually i forgot because i muted him but the undying just kept saying retarded shit in all caps at the beginning of the game and kept dying to bloodseeker jungle ganks early on (didnt know this was a thing) and tehn he would blame our supports top for being useless despite the fact that the warlock kept wanting to dual lane with him and they wouldve done well but undying kept repeating SOLO SOLO SOLO and NOOB and cuation pinging the warlock before laning phase even started

just hold ur storms hand and suck his dick mid and he'll snowball out of control + you have pl carrying,

if u chose like abba lion oracle dazzle ww i think that games veryw innable ,

just think about it if u go nyx ur just draining gold that could be going to ur storm/pl and ur giving them way less safe space to farm the map. and u went dagon instead of a blink/euls/force/aghs so ur initation/potential to save ur teammates is nonexistent

A little bit about me,
Heyo,,
,
I'm actually quite new to streaming and didn't initially plan on creating a ""Profile"" but someone has pushed me to do it so here we go.,
,
I've played the **** genre for about 10 years (a ballpark figure) dating back to DotA v6.5X or something where I'd stomp the open leagues xD,
,
Once HoN was released I hated on the game for being ""garbage"" but eventually I grew fond of it and played the game a f*ck ton. I pretty much no lifed it for a while, but I was getting very good. Good enough to become recognized on the forums and as a competitive player on team xFin ahaha. I played with WayToSexy, Sneyking and Sender against the best players the game had to offer and the more we played the better we got as a team and we began to upset some of the bigger teams! Unfortunately all good things come to an end... Being pushed by my parents to continue my schooling after graduating high school I went to school for a General Business course but freaking hated it but it got them off my back.,
,
It was around this time that Fogged told me about DotA 2's super secret alpha release, I think he even hooked me up with a key ahaha. At that time there were maybe 500 of us playing it, only I hated it cause the input delay ughhhhh that input delay... To anyone that knows what I'm talking about I'm sure they'll agree ahaha.,
,
Anyways, as you could have probably guessed I began to like DotA 2, cause like... Who wouldn't? And so me, WayToSexy, Sneyking, Taku and Bdiz decided we'd play some competitive DotA 2 together. We upset a few of the big teams around that time under the C9 or GDT tag (can't quite remember) then as history repeats itself, I quit DotA 2 for school. This time it was something I wanted to do, so I pretty much broke contact with the internet for about 2 years time and went to school full-time.,
,
Since then, I've been working full-time... I even bought a house with my girlfriend! All that said I now actually have more time on my hands... So it's game time!!,
,
So you'll find me streaming CS:GO or DotA 2 quite often as I play with my acquired friends over the years.,
,
Cheers guys!

,
Then the other team has an antimage that gets dual laned, builds heart after manta, and you build a linkens. GG!

						"

							account buying isnt event hat big of a problem on us servers,
,
like if u can name 5 legit account buyers >5.5k (not just people who have a bad game) id be quite surprised,
,
and if ur talking to me forrest picking luna and sf into those heroes is asking to lose to begin with. having an incompetent sf who cant land a raze and goes 1st item bkb into wyvern tuskar and spiritbreaker doesnt help either and a luna who goes hotd yasha against a lineup that jsut runs at you doesnt make much sense,
,
at that point u just decide to do whatever because ur not winning that game regardless of how well u do on bh. if a games actually winnable i might care but when ur highest mmr picks an offlane weaver to practice it or something and the other team has 5 retard heroes and my team picks luna and sf and we have a peruvian dazzle u just move on and play

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							dunno but i think it's clear at this point that dota is balanced by monkeys.  they just forget about some heroes for 8 patches.  meanwhile they fixate on a few heroes and buff them every patch.  they apparently expect people to instantly figure out which heroes are good so if lesh gets buffed and is still not picked they just keep buffing him every patch.  in reality it takes months for people to start playing a new hero that got buffed, it almost never happens instantly.  this is what happened to lesh and lina.  they get buffed 8 patches in a row and now theyre absurd.,
,
they should hotfix shit that;s clearly broken, or takea  more measured approach to buffing and nerfing heroes.,
,
rmm should include bans, without question.  it's jsut goddamn awful right now, beyond belief.  it;s a bunch of clueless chimps spamming sb bs lesh lina bh etc etc and running at each other like mongoloids,  anything would be better than this trash.

the game has been balanced so that pubtrash can succeed, with zero fucks given about top play,
,
,
lose every lane with poor laning mechanics?  no problem, you get a gank kill you get more gold than you could farm in 2 full minutes with stacked camps,
,
cant last hit?  no problem, passive gold increased to -em levels.  oh we also nerfed creep gold so that people who can last hit and farm efficiently outside of the jungle dont have an advantage anymore,
,
you still not able to do any of that?  no problem, we buffed uphill advantage to the point where even if you're 20k gold and experience behind, youll get it all back in one team fight!,
,
,
its all balanced around terrible mechanic theorycrafters providing themselves affirmative win% just because they know how to pick heroes that will always win.  its no longer a game of tiny victories, its just affirmative win% who can spam the best hero combo will win unless the other team REALLY screws up,
,
which boils ranked down to who can 5 man first, but nobody does, because people are so awful they cant figure this shit out after years of dota, and they never will,
,
until the game goes hardcore again dota will still suck, but it wont, because valve devs are 2k

Suddenly these 5k players were all playing like 2k, theres nothing i could do, no position or hero i would choose, it was all meaningless. People would feed couriers and afk fountain after 1 death lol.... , Ppl would pick storm support. It was hell. ,

						"

							RMM is fundamentally unsatisfying because your performance is not going to determine the outcome of the game, even if you wreck your lane 1v1, if your other lanes fail miserably to the point that your advantage is not enough.,

are you the dazzle
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Does anyone know why in the regions reborn shows like 50 ping less than source 1 did but when I'm actually in the game my ping to USE and USW is the same as it was before? Why does it show that I have 60 ping to USE on the region pick screen but I actually get my usual 110? Or 80 to USW and I get ~130?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							probably bc the ping screen uses a different method to get ping.  just like how typing -ping gives a different result compared to console ping (no longer valid, they removed ping in console) and was different from netgraph ping as well.  some of them include built in delay from the game i beleive.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Maybe your true ping includes the different delays on your machine (keyboard, GPU etc)
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							That makes sense I guess. It was a stupid question because the answer doesn't matter, since I'm gonna have whatever ping I have anyways. ,

							keyboard and GPU ping huh
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,no i am not in that game
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							why is this game not region locked in 2015???????????/
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,GPU and keyboard add input lag. Maybe its able to pinpoint the extra MS.
						"

							I maintain a solid 50% winrate at my current MMR where half my games I'm 20-0 and the other half I just get griefed and don't have a chance to carry them. Maybe my weakness isn't my DotA skill but actually my problem solving and retard coddling abilities.

Having seen the players in this pool, do you really believe it is a ""human experiment gone wrong?"" ,

If this pool didn't exist these players would be turning up in everybody's ranked MM games. In this case at least you know that you can avoid these teammates by being a nicer person.

							Not played Dota in 5 months due to moving to a different continent, so I've pretty much missed out on this entire patch. Went to the local gaming cafe to play some Dotes, played 5 unranked games to get used to things again where I picked fotm shit like bounty, Storm etc and went 5-0 in games.

I do know in some of the other pools both teams are part of it (yes, there are more pools than just hidden and normal mm).
						"

						"

							,what's your point, if you're joining the brain power that goes into picking into some idea of ""skill"" then how could team A have significantly worse picks on the regular than team B when team A and team B are ostensible of equal or near-equal skill (as tk_ and imfamous seem to be suggesting in the last page or so) lolz
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,are u stupid,
,
who ever fucking said that idiots are on their team and geniuses are on the other,
,
of course after a fucking loss someone's gonna be mad/frustrated and blame their teammates but no one ever said the opposing players were any good,
,
but Hey Lol I said Cognitive DIssonance Im So Smart
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,believe this is everyone who's ever complained about ""hidden pool"" which may not include you but definitely includes imfamous
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							the true answer is that the outcome of a game is dependent on both picks , skill, with either affecting a specific game in a different manner
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							hidden pool is also a real thing but it doesnt exist in the way people think it does in that they only get to play with retards against good players lol
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,haha so is the implication that your team was monkeys and the other team was also monkeys therefore you lost to monkeys??????
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							well even if he thinks theres a hidden pool surely he thinks that both teams' players are in the hidden pool not that only his teammates are.,
,
as retarded as he is i dont think he thinks his opponents are much better than his teammates
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							cognitive dissonance is unrelated to 6 games in a row with 0 disables (except if you yourself picked one),
,
against storm/huskar/whatever else the fuck
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							u realize its incredibly common to have people not pick hard disables in this meta because a lot of the good heroes that people play just dont have them
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,case in point lolz
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							honestly people that blame the meta for their losing are just stupid lol
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							when ppl mention skill in dota its usually more to do with mechanics and awareness and shit. you can pick well and be bad and u can also be skilled and pick retarded heroes. they're not mutually exclusive
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,after game because of frustration i will delude myself into thinking my team is awful and thats why we lost, not because the other team is good. in reality though, both teams are of similar skill (including myself) and i am probably part of the reason we lost,
,
isnt this standard for like every dota player?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
,
believe that means you don't have cognitive dissonance,
,
imfamous on the other hand...
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,i would add there are very few heroes that i think outright lose the game no matter how and where u pick it and i would ascribe naix to that specific tier
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							being a good player usually calls for both. but at a high enough mmr ppl usually understand the operation of dota enough to know what they ""should"" do. you can definitely say the enemy team is better than ur team at pickimg even if ur both equally skilled
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							some heroes are especially good against others. ud think at the top 1% of player base or w.E this is enough to maybe determine more or less how each draft sequentially plays out from the first to the last pick. but most of the time players buy an account cause thry already think they are better than 3k and proceed to pick whatever because they believe they are skilled enough to compensate. that's the type of shit kzz gets stuck with. it's nothing new
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							kzz has less map awareness than a 4k when he mids and has no idea people are ganking his lane because hes too busy fumbling bottle crowing,
,
its easy to wonder why people give up playing with him so quickly
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I've seen kzz play so I know that's not true. are u sure u didn't just run down mid like he said and fed and are now finding shit to downplay ur lack of everything dota related
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							not gonna pass flash judgement but ppl usually side with him on this sort of thing
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I dunno what some of you are smoking but draft does matter and does decide outcome of a game on average imo. And those of you saying it doesn't clearly do not play enough or do not play at a high enough mmr for it to matter. And using an example of losing to a horrible lineup, that does happen but the frequency and chance of such an event is fucking low when compared to games in general in a large sample size. ,
,
Also I fully agree picking the right hero for the situation takes some thought. ,
,
As a conclusion im pretty sure everyone who argues ""that draft and picks dont matter lolz"" are the brain dead randomers who ruin all pick and then blame peru and their team for the loss.
						"

							the reason i like KZZ is because he plays ""high-skill"" heroes like puck, ES mid, etc.  blink force-staff shit that actually requires a minimum of 2 brain cells to operate past 4-5k.,
,
last 2 patches its been -- Troll, Jug, Sniper, Lesh, Storm, BLOODSEEKER, PL.    These heroes require almost no skill and can just win the game if they get farm
						"

							kzz doesnt play puck anymore because it's awful and i don't think anyone can argue es is a high skill hero

							i wonder if dota is moving in a better direction or a worse direction,
,
i generally enjoy myself playing pubs even against lesh/bs/storm. it's bullshit sometimes but not entirely impossible.,
,
however i think i subconsciously play worse when there's a techies on my team because I want that person to lose
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
,
,
hehe
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							well the way i see it is that dota became so unbearable for me in november 2014 that i stopped playing and didnt play even one game until june 2015, whereas now im actively playing the game. so i'd say that despite this patchs flaws, i enjoy it much more than the abomination of 6.81-3
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							fredj lectured me on how i wasnt trying hard enough on picks when i picked an antimage to farm top (he was a offlane weaver that was picked after me)
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							well it actually takes skill to play bloodseeker past 5k more often than not because the hero is so useless against any ounce of coordination or a well farmed lina/lesh.  that's why you only see a small handful of people able to pull it off.  at least in games that were close to begin with.,
,
but you guys who only play heroes with 3 escape mechanisms and/or blink/euls as core pickups can troll this all you want because I'm sure you will.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							anyone thats capable of winning mm games with qop knows something i dont know
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,xD
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,hahahahahahahahaha
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,im just saying atleast he doesnt spam BLOODSEEKER pl and fucking other broken  pub heroes to get the magical 6k
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							maybe im mad because i have 3 accounts in the mid 5ks but dont want to play those heroes,
maybe im not good enough to get 6k by playing random,
,
o well
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							did cv already get replaced
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							well i resolved to stop flaming my teammates.  earlier today i had a 5.8k lina who got some kills in lane/the river and otherwise did nothing but farm all game and then we lost so i called her a zero impact potato at the end but i don't think that counts because i did not swear
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							, storms one of the ""highest-skill"" heroes in the game and it snot like those other heroes are all super simple to play compared to the other 90% of dota heroes, especially troll, jugg, and pl.  perhaps the word ur looking for is overpowered, at least in the context of pubs.  if a hero is overpowered in pubs then yeah its gonna look easier to play but thats gonna be true of any hero in the game.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Dotas not fun anymore unless u mentalize urself to farm no matter what happens
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							lets be real here the cookie cutter storm basically just has you go into the jungle press q for 10 minutes come out with a bloodstone and then jump on heroes from halfway across the map and win,
,
thats not an option on puck/shaker/clock/whatever. im not sure what ur saying about troll but that hero is super straightforward
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,LMFAO.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							someone typed that wow,
,
3 escape mechanisms -> bloodseeker,
,
:/
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,if storm is hard to play then how come 90% of people over 6k have storm in their top 5 with 60%+ win?,
,
yeah maybe it's hard to play it perfectly, but it's easy to play it at a high enough level to win mmr.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							whenever the highest rated player on the enemy team picks bs i already know i won because he's at least 500 mmr overrated and clearly a retard.  thanks zhamar!
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,this is the worst rationalization i have ever seen
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yeah i actually cannot understand how people like this just don't own up to their hero picking
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i pick meta heroes all day and i dont give a Fuck
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							overthrow is way better than dota
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							the only hard part of playing storm spirit is laning against shit like leshrac/lina and that's mitigated pretty well by jungling.  the only way you're really and truly fucked is if you get destroyed in lane/get roamed and have some useless jungler eating the entire jungle so you either have to roam or tower hug
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							storm sitll wins half the time he gets destroyed in lane because he can choose when to enter ganks so easily and u can lways tp and get 3 kills
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							reduce base armor
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,because hes that overpowered in pubs.  also i think a majority of 6k players are or have in the past been frequent mid pickers and storms always been a popular and decent mid in pubs
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							storm's observably broken in competitive too even if the impact is not as obvious
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i think if u have storm and antimage on the same team u pretty much autowin. u just get splitpushed to death and nobody really knows what to do in pubs
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,its fine if you do it at the end
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Mr. Cash most talented player NA according to Imfamous.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							people mega overrated am vs storm,
,
i think storm's lategame is better Lol and if u get a 16 min orchid u can solo am until he has manta
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,That's what a 5 minute window? Orchid is 100 mana on a 800-900 mana pool at that point. If theres somebody to help AM its almost auto dead for SS.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							it's a lot more than a 5 min window if storm kills him once or twice in it...
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							am is alone all the time it's incredibly easy for storm with orchid tokill him pre manta
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Storm counters am. Without dying your orchid shouldn't come later than 11-12 minutes. Or you're building the wrong gear, either way Storm is OP.,
,
 AM + Storm on the same team is the most garbage shit you could have, a single 4k huskar would dispatch a 7k storm and 7k am in the same game and it wouldn't be close
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I think it's fairly balanced in comp. If you buy an orchid people will move accordingly. I don't really think pub should dictate patch notes that much, on top of that he's still at 50% in highest skill brackets of RMM. He's a pretty shit laner compared to the laning monsters of this patch (SF,Lina,TA,Leshrac), Dire's really harder than Radiant.,
,
I think he suffers from the Tinker syndrome as he doesn't actually win that often but when it does it's usually in a ridiculous snowball/comeback manner so it looks overpowered.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							are u FUCKING high he's not even remotely balanced in comp did u watch the international?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i mean storm's gonna get nerfed a fuckton because bloodstone is getting nerfed.  orchid is clearly broken too and always has been (half the time orchid effect is better than hex Lol and the buildup is waaay better and easier) wouldn't be surprised if it got nerfed.  i'm sure jungle is gettign nerfed also.  so even if storm doesn't get touched himself he's gonna be way weaker next patch.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Yeah he was like 10-9. I mean on Suma1l he looks broken but watching resolution playing you'd think that hero can't do shit. That's what I mean by the Tinker effect, his victories are much more memorable than when he just gets roflstomped in lane and does nothing.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yeah you better put that 1 in his name or the eg copyright pollice might nab u Olol,
,
yeah anyway you're clearly retarded and dumb if u think storm's not broken.  Heh.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I mean hes very strong. I just think you don't need to nerf him that bad. Just make it so you can't gain charges on buyback, or force him to level pull. I'm sure some minor change that accentuates his laning weaknesses and it'll be fine.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Orchid is better than hex? It is countered by every semi-defensive item in the game. Glimmer, bkb, manta, lotus, diffusal, euls, I'm probably forgetting some.,
,
Pretty much every orchid hero is better off skipping the item and building something that scales better. Storm is the exception because he needs attack speed, but I still think bloodstone is a better first item in most games.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							storm with a good start is some unstoppable shit.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							8th most picked hero at TI5 and 58% win rate.  maybe people exaggerate it some but im pretty sure he is OP in all games and not just pubs
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							scofield 7.5k thanx storm spirit oOlolool
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							kzz do u take questions? ,
,
where does the name kzz come from
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Icefrogs gonna do some pseudofix for storm like nerfing his movespeed and armor again then calling it a day
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I though scofield spammed huskar
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							The issue with nerfing storm is that he's either great  or dogshit. Puck is super underrated I think. He's great aganist any mid right now. The issue with him is that he falls off so fucking hard once other heroes get items
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							puck is garbage against bloodseeker due to rupture and trying to make tight nukes with low hp
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							puck aghs is the only saving grace
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,lurie alt?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,This is pretty dumb too, they're both good heroes and it's not like they're terrible with each other
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							pucks garbage right now because illusory orb is a terrible fucking spell
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,the saving grace is actually octarine core,  im pretty sure its impossible to die once u get blink euls octarine
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							hope they increase illusory orb's velocity
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I start flaming in pubs again and suddenly I'm playing with MoM->rapier SFs and earthshakers trying to take my cs mid.,
,
HMMMMMMM
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							its that Hidden pool.,
,
if you see ImFamouns tell him i said hi from the Visible pool
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							the problem with puck is the CD on his nukes are ridic long.  yaeh one of them has a blink attached and the other is a silence, but the cds are like 2x as long as other int heroes so he's a worse farmer and does way less damage in teamfights.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I'm sure he has the ability to hivemindcontrol the other peruvians. Every game I play with him they automatically gank mid as 3 and then stack his camps ignoring every other lane.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							is it 6.84 or reborn being shit or a combination of both, that is causing every game to be an utter joke?,
,
no matter what, every fucking game ive played recently has either had someone on the enemy team OR my team:,
,
1. intentionally feed,
2. afk,
3. straight up abandon,
4. pick REALLY REALLY retarded heroes like alchemist or void, and at the same time instalock them or ""steal"" the lane from a person who already highlighted the lane,
5. a combination of the above,
,
like 5 games in a row have been this. 3 on my team where it was autoloss, 2 times the enemy team gave us a free win
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,i saw him picking am and tb and winning games with those heroes and other safelaners, so I was like wtf how did this 6.2k kiddie magically become super good?,
,
is it true though that he just played like a hundred storm games in a row? cuz i ahevnt seen much, but form what I have seen, he seems to win with other heroes too

I'm 5k atm, ive been 6k or 4k before, but I don't really count pubs into my skill. I've played competitive for a year and a half now, with good showings as a captain vs Boreal, Leviathan, and Ehug. Stomped by COL sadly. I've also played nel for over a year before it shut down.,

i played 4 games yesterday, and 3 of them were over by 10 minutes with someone griefing, maybe its cus my mmr isnt that high (5-5.2k) not sure,

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							im assuming that by ""just as fast"" you meant ""slower than he did before because his spells cost more mana now""
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Well by the time he goes for his stacks he's got lvl 2-3 in remnants so 20 to 10 mana difference. I think it's just harder to gank early.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yeah i think the bigger problem was always 15 charge bloodstone storms zipping from camp to camp and farming the entire jungle in 30 seconds, now its much more expensive to do that. saying the he can farm midgame stacks just as easily doesnt mean shit tbqhimho
						"

						"

,
their invoker was 0:5 at 10 mins and 15 minutes later he has aghs euls bots because their earthshaker cried so hard valve replaced my teammates with bots,
,
my wd and aa literally just sat in lanes and farmed their aghs and fed the enemy team after the first 8 minutes and my pl rushed manta first item and only had that and a diffusal blade after farming the entire game. i would pick off 2 heroes and then get the kitchen sink thrown at me and my team would somehow wipe in the resulting teamfight every single fucking time,
,
after they make 0 effort to contest the bots just walk around the pit and die and then my retarded cores decide its a good idea to fight 2v5 and then they die also, meanwhile i push down their t3 and take a ranged rax after killing their bh who tpd, boughtback and i killed him again, and then i forced huskar to tp back and they still wipe in the resultant teamfight. i also got to see my wd channel his first aghs ult for .5 seconds before it got cancelled by earthshaker,
,
this game makes me so fucking mad actually
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Yeah but you realize these retards will do the same trick once they know what's op this patch right?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,No u fucking moron u dont use ur ult for farming,
,
U always leveled ur remnant to atleast 3 so at best thats a 10 mana difference
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Oh nvm just gonna leave an elegiggle here
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,It means he can't go jungle at 3 minutes in because lane is too hard, then still hit 6 at the same time as the enemy Lesh/ Lina did. He has to wait until level 7 at least before jungle efficiency/speed becomes comparable to 6.84's
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Yeah but they also punched in the dick the other meta heroes who would dick him in lane. If you're Radiant it's still playable. Dire is total shit. He's going to be a pocket pick again which is fine.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,he can still do it he'll just bottle crow lolz its not like 20-30 extra mana is gonna rpevent u from clearing stacks/jungling
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,hopefully it's not as obnoxious tho
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							We all do....
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,so forcing him to bottle crow makes the hero less efficient how is this a difficult concept? your flaming me but im actually right and ur wrong Lmao
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							old storm could literally zip from camp to camp and lane to lane in some situations late game with blood stone stacks and other big items, new storm cant do it nearly as efficiently because of the mana increase on his ult. obviously i wanst implying u just spam ball lightning to farm u morose child
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							obviously anyone above 4k can determine that his farming rate between like level 7 and and 15 is the same as it was before
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							im greyboxing tk
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,4hed
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							when storms actually ""Zip From Lane To Lane To Farm"" they go back to abse after because thyre out of mana thats unchanged.,
,
ur making it out to be like every game storm would just ult from camp to camp to lane like am would blink and still have mana to Chill
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							fuck im way too upset over this actually im taking a break from reading casey posts
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if storm has 2k total mana,,

before it would cost 155 mana for the original zip,

now its 190,

this retard just picks windrunner and other shit and is a generally annoying retard who types at his whole team the whole game and makes u want to kill urself to not be part of the same species as he is.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yea ur awful actulaly,
,
im actually unsure how i get games where my luna afk hits creeps then dies to a pinged ward and feeds away the whole stack,
,
or a legion that just non stop feeds and has no item 30 minutes in,
,
or a bounty hunter whos 0-2-0 at 12 minutes and barely hits level 6 even though hes afk farming bottom,
,
but yea im sure its on me haha
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							you're so dumb LOL
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,get off my website u demented ape
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							so which one of those players were you scsf,
,
please do come forward,
,
oh yea and timado great 20 minute treads yasha into a 40 minute blink dagger sny bkb while feeding an offlane batrider the entire game and not skilling ur ultimate until level 10 ,

really great terrorblade player haha
						"

						"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I thought SCSF was 3.8k
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							like im trying to figure out which one of those players is scsf,
,
2-12 disruptor ,
0-2-0 at 12 minutes while afk farming against a solo antimage bount yhunte who then rushes dagon,
0-12-7 peruvian legion with no items,
,
which one is it haha,
,
and timado remind me what u accomplished in either game as a terrorblade or luna other than mindlessly hit creeps,
,
like at least hit buildings when we're fighting if ur not going to participate in fights or something as a terrorblade haha
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							None of those is SCSF, he was just watching Timado stream,
,
also you really didn't play well either kitrak...

i've been in ur previous games but watching u on timado stream reaffirmed my belief that ur a retard
						"

						"

							,You didn't play great either, I watched the replay and you had less impact than both Timado and the shitty BH so...
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							sorry you went 0-6 against an offlane batrider in 10 minutes and youre telling me i sucked ass,
,
you went goddamn sny blink at 30 minutes and didnt take the tower in ur lane as terrorblade even though nobody showed up in that lane after 8 minutes because somehow batrider got an 8 minute blink from laning lolz,
,
and pepper im not referring to that game obviously that was just a bad game but theres really now ay that game was winnable anyway. that game had a peruvian legion who was dying randomly in the offlane a dagon rush bounty hunter and as a result no real way to deal with an antimage and legion,

at least the other game was actually potentially winnable

							uhm wwd he died 6 times in the enemy safelane pushing a tier 2 when no heroes were showing on the map ,
,
he died the exact same way 6 times after i pinged him multiple times to leave. literally the enemy necro walked from our t3 mid to where the radiant t1 was bottom over 3 wards and we pinged him 10 tmies and he died,
,
stats definitely do tell what you do in a game if ur on a core hero and your gpms shit, you feed the whole game, you have no tower damage, and no hero damage on a hero like lone druid. ,
,
like i cant tihnk of any scenario where a support 5 position rubick who loses like 1000 gold buying support shit has the same gpm as a guy who afk rices the entire game,
,
and im not sure how lag makes a player afk rice next to the enemy tier 2 and repeatedly die while ur team tells u to stop going there when theres no heroes showing on the map. pretty sure he wasnt lagging either, his reactiont ime seemed fine from what i could tell. he just had no clue what he was doing.

							the puck approach is no approach at all
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i mean u can build for damage and try to do a lot of team damage.  i usually went radiance first (only if i ha 3k gold + treeads around 15 minutes).  or u can go treads blink linken's into damage items, mjolnir+skadi+crit are good damage items on him.  if you actually get to lategame with hex shiva's blink refresh then you're going to hit for 200 damage and be really hard to kill and do lots of disables and mgic damage.  or u can go dagon eth blade and try to win early.  or u can go agha and hope your teammates are good.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I usually go Dagon eth and get 30 kills and still lose half the time, it's usually fun but rage inducing because you try so hard and still lose
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Blink+Eul's into Force/Aghs/Sheep/Linken/Shiva/Octarine depending on the game.

undying aghs is a curse, entire enemy team just chain silences/stuns you in fights while your 4.4k safelane slardar struggles to build 1 item
						"

90% of the time u need to build items that keep you and your team alive during burst damage/focus fire,

the aghs is fucking shit for that.

							,damn ur streak . that sux
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Its a 330 dmg aoe nuke that also heals you on a 4 second cooldown its pretty decent. (and lowers hp regen/dmg of str heroes etc). Plus the 190 dmg from the str drain is basically pure dmg
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yea if you look at it like that it's dope, but in reality ur a hero with no armor and no bkb that gets silenced or stunned,

it only really helps u stay alive. it's better to keep ur team going as long as possible based on my games with him this patch, so items like greaves/pipe/crest do way more,

not that it's bad. it's just so overrated from everything I've seen. It's a winning hard, win harder item. It won't turn even games unless the enemy is braindead
						"

						"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,excuse me ?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

my reaction to him not buying sentries was 100% a straw breaking the camel's back type of situation soz
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							thats some a2k shit if i ever seen it.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							When dota starts affecting your personal relationships it's usually a sign that you need to seek help.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,ya I'm not saying I'm not partially at fault or whatever, I was definitely a massive asshole when I called him out for it after the game, hence apologizing,
,
maybe my thinking on this is inaccurate but when I solo queue and I'm on support for random strangers I don't have a problem doing basic support functions like buying sentries for mid vs bh and rotating to help carries and shit like that, so I would think when playing with someone you've been friends with for ~10 years getting supports to do basic things to help other players wouldn't be like pulling teeth, so that was where my frustration came from in the moment,

anyways I'm sure we'll talk it out and things will be fine in like 3 or 4 days lolz
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,guess I'm in the minority then soz,

am I the only one here that ever played team sports like calling someone out for fucking up is a pretty normal part of the social male experience and usually dudes argue and/or fight in the moment and then chill and everything's cool lol,

the only thing noteworthy about this particular incident imo is how scorched earth he went on social media about it
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							wait legato was there a troll/sky in that game,

i lost to a roaming support clinkz who killed my 6k mmr mid and offlane player and they flamed me for it even though i was safelaning, they were in a 3 man stack it was some shit,

Or whatever guy in ixdl I played with
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I am aware that the reason I'm 4k is that when some prick tells me to do whatever he wants bc he's 5k I go cliff prophet,

there was this phase where I rose to 5k because I sucked it up and played with the team

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
,
my ta was the lowest mmr in the game and was adamant he should mid. he also was sure that the reason he is 4k is because other 4ks made him tilt and he lost mmr. this statement was disproved when he walked up highground into an ulting sf that he had vision of with all refraction charges gone and with refraction on cd for 7 more seconds. he also farmed the entire game and only managed a 20 minute desolator.,
,
even while im 10:2(with one suicide) in the span of about 15 minutes on roaming pudge and being the only person buying wards my earth spirit skywrath and ta managed to feed hard enough that naga with a 18 min radiance couldn't carry the game.,
,
what to take away from this is davidw is a retard who spammed storm spirit for 669 games and only managed 55% winrate and u should dodge him
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,this isn't true for everyone. its fascinating to me that lots of people can still try their best, or at least go 70-80%, when you just have 2-4 vile human beings/spanish speakers on your team. Are you aware that if you try super hard and carry these revolting idiots they are going to gain as much mmr as you are and continue propagating their putrid existence all across USeast?  I just can't bring myself to do it half the time. Even though I'd like in theory to win and gain mmr and play well thereby *improving at dota* my brain  just doesn't co-operate. I got an extremely low stop trying to win threshold I think. I am trying to work on it and improve myself though ,
At the end of the day I'm just here until someone releases a decent 1v1 rts I think team games arent for me.

these are all matches where i was the best performing member on my team, all consecutive,
what does that tell you
						"

title default,link default,user default,"

, <- zyufin alch with mom deso jugg with no healing ward skilled,
, <- ""qop support"",
,
,
4 more for u forrest and these are all recent games,
,
if anything i want to know how i can do better so that i can play perfect games every time and carry 1v5; which is why im on nadota in the first place, since i want advice from the better players, so to say
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,No I rarely communicate with my teammates, and when I do it's just goofy stuff. This has nothing to do with me though, but thanks,
,
,If you consecutively own matches and think your MMR is under what it should be and you've deluded yourself into thinking that there's some 'hidden pool' you should probably just do some self-reflection and realize your attitude is what holds you back. You very well may be higher skilled than your MMR peers but your attitude is probably just shit - which would be my guess based on your posts here,
,
,This isn't an advice thread. If you really want advice people to get better than put in some effort yourself to make you better. If spamming games doesn't make you better then try to watch and analyze your own replays. If that doesn't work then try and make a youtube VOD of your own self-reflection and put some effort and show people that you've actively trying to get better and I'm sure people will give you some solid advice. People will put in as much effort as you do normally.

theres no way this guy should be higher than 4k,

we kill phoenix again,
we zone him out of lane entirely ,

							So this is unrelated but I found it interesting:,
,
Checking on dotamax, ursa's winrate from 6.84 > 6.85 dropped, but if you compare Ranked All Skill levels to Ranked Very High only, ursa's winrate actually went up in 6.85 (56.31% 6.84, 57.10% or something in 6.85),
,
I think the cooldown reduction on Enrage made him more useful since better players can deal with ursas burst better anyways (which is what got nerfed in return for the 30 sec cd enrage)

hoenstly i want to go back to 6.84, every sub 5.5k ive gotten recently just picks doom and other shit and cant doom the heroes youre supposed to doom, goes jungle gets midas feeds takes runes and then theres offlane huskars who are level 1 at 7 minutes and 0-5
						"

							sunbhies one of the worst people u can paly with
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							he picks a meme hero and then loses the lane he goes to, builds the wrong ass items, has some garbage ass decision making, and tries to guide the team with his pseudo leadership and then jsut loses the game

						"

							I played with one of those dudes from the Reddit post about buying accounts, he wasn't even that unpleasant to play with. He just made some bad decisions and didn't farm well.
						"

							im sure sunbhies a nice guy and everything but he tries to take a leadership role and i just think his brain and decision making is real fucking small and bad when it comes to dota and his actual mechanical/laning skill isnt good enough to compensate for it so its fucking awful to paly with

if u repeatedly tell someone who doesnt want to pick doom offlane to do so and he does because he wants to satisfy your autistic needs as a teammate and leave him solo while diving mid 3v1 and feeding ember a double kill u should probably end ur life,

or at least deserve to let the doom feed the game away

light blue cited that my lack of aquila and treads were why we were losing and i can't even repeat what pink and grey were saying because it was so fucking convoluted i could just pick english words at random and string them together and it'd be comparable to what they were typing
						"

							basically i'm renouncing spectre because every time i pick it i get teammates like those
						"

Your only sign of personality is shown through the asians and indians who you imitate to compensate for the fact you have no culture of your own. You have literally no distinctive feature outside of having a ton of immigrants.,

You litteraly have no cuisine, cinema or any form of arts designed in house, you are descendants of the people who were too dumb and gay to participate in the american revolution. You always act like having a ton of immigrants is a proof of your higher charachter and everybody who doesn't like to water down his own heritage in the same way is a racist retard even though you genocided the natives.

tuskar doesnt know how to use his abilities and basically did nothing the whole game ,

brown misses every ult,

enemy team just runs at me the whole game with slardar/lesh/lina. guess i ended up creating space for slark in the end but honestly ive now had back to back games where my team picks 3-4 useless heroes that do absolutely nothing in fights and do no damage and then i just get run at because we cant kill anyone. just going to ask people to pick spiritbreaker and omni or something from now on.

Probably alt account of some 6k player, possible boosting for someone on the other team,
Our team winning so fucking hard and he was 8-0-2 something mid wr but at some point he just stop playing and sold his all item for no reason,

Enemy team doom kept typing something US East culture and wr type something bara being Peruvian but there is no real explanation of this throw. Game was very good until that point,

so fucking frustrating
						"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,WR had aghs blink finished at 15min then immediately sold all items while our team was actively communicating and had total map control,
Brood Ember BH all overextend and fed our team at least four times each, slark got shut down hard. Dire had no chance at all :/ I mean objectively every single one of them was so fucking bad except doom considering avg 5.6k game,
,
I checked other team players' history but couldn't find much overlap. Probably enable/disable public profile during boosting games or something,
I will monitor that doom's ingame history for next few days I guess... I hate losing like this

peruvian alch who doesnt skill greed before taking bounty rune, best part is he takes it like 1-2s after, chink doom who dooms creeps and illusions and calls me '4k' trash when hes 4700 and im 300 higher than him, oracle and rubick who soak exp and make 0 attempt to zone pugna, then oracle goes mid and afk farms his arcane boots while i get trilaned and alch farms jungle,
,
,
this wr , afk farmed for 20 mins and didnt have any items, just let me die repeatedly and let kills walk away as she ran from every fight i initiated,
,
,
the most infurating player of them all, he picks dp goes mid and afk farms literally the entire game and does not use his ult. he does not splitpush, he just afk farms his bloodstone while he lets kills walk away. i also get low prio for trying to carry said retard

as usual the magnus cliffs himself while trying to cliff someone else Haha,

if ur not arise or someone i dont even know why you would pick that hero in the offlane,

then again hes got LFT in his name and hes 4k so it makes sense

							funny thing about that game was our ember kept begging us to pick doom too but in the end noone picked doom on either team bc noone felt like playing it
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

its a miracle i didnt start griefing from the beginning, its funny im pretty sure that game was winnable if the retard didnt die stupidly and start griefing,

im looking at the replay right now and im even with him on cs after spending 45 seconds to go help you morons bottom,

but hey what do i know haha 2.7k hero damage no kills skywrath mage must have done some really great work,

actually nevermind shaker just took my rune every 2 minutes for the first 6 minutes without asking me if i wanted it and showed up mid once 3 minutes in pressed q pushed out the lane and left again,

							do you even play ranked or understand how games work when you're a 6k player and theres 4ks/low to mid 5ks in your games,

those are the only games where i give a shit what people pick,
,
and almost all of these low to mid 5ks are braindead spics/chinks who are absolutely horrible and dont know how to play anything other than spiritbreaker/bounty/undying/whatever in ranked,
,
and the only heroes ive ever asked people to pick are doom/slardar with the first pick because the other teams going to pick one or both of them if my team doesnt pick them

						"
title default,link default,user default,"

sometimes i have bad games and die like 14 times on sb but i've never really had any1 flame or complain at me about that cuz most of the time the games done and i just charge into their team for funzies,

it's weird tho the guys who complain a lot in this thread also have been posted, or their play flamed back at them. Maybe i'm just lucky that i don't get nadotaers on my bad games,

i saw ixmike climb to 6k picking sb every game, figured i'd give it a shot

u just camp and tilt him. do what u gotta do for mmr.

Also I would like to know how someone ""inflate his mmr"" by playing weaver. If anything, you should revise your definition of mmr inflation. Tralf is a better exemple of mmr inflation, he takes ember mid and get his bottle at the 6 minutes mark and blames the slardar for taking his bounty rune.,
,
Edit : According to dotabuff, your most played heroes are storm, ember, tinker, sf , morph, void , am . Like I said, you think you're good at this game but you just spam the meta, you have no intrinsic skill, no personality, no signature, a little sheep that's irrevelant to the dota scene. I'd gladly take your top 5 hero mid for a 1v1.

It's funny that you talk shit, you were pretty much a non factor in the game, feeding left and right. Your only victory in a sense was to deny me weaver.

						"

							just do it he's not good
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							oh nevermind i dont have to be weaver he just expects to play weaver in a 1v1

							....
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							gg!
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I mean who are you kidding, I'm asking for a 1v1 weaver vs your top mid hero, sf ,storm whatever you want. You really expect me to play 1v1 sf mid when I have 0 sf games. When I asked for a 1v1, you knew what it was about, what a fuckin waste of time.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							u have 4500 games of weaver,
,
also 1v1s are sf vs sf
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Basically a dodge, gg next challenger.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yeah so basically you're shit and can only play weaver,
,
I'm certainly not being biased cause I like tk more, if anything the opposite,
,
but you can;t go into an NADota 1v1 and expect to play weaver rofl TARD
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							you're the one who literally dodged you trashcan,
,
you said I'm out and left lobby
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Yeah I can only play Weaver, I'm fuckin FredJ, that's my thing.  Everyone knows that and when you're challenging me for a 1v1, I hope you're not fuckin expecting me to play anything else but weaver, it's just common sense. rofl
						"

							askin g for weaver in a 1v1L MAO
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Things don't look good for our hero
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I mean if he wanted to prove he's a better SF than me, I don't have to play a fuckin game for that, he definately is.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							next time u as kfor a 1v1 i recommend u clarifiy that u want o play weaver so people know to ignore u
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,how is that bad
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if u think people are supposed to magically pull out 60% winrates with 4500 games on a hero ur braindead
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,My bad, I thought it was clear from the start since that's the only hero I play, it's only common sense for me to play it. It's just common logic. It's like asking broxy for a 1v1 sf mid.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							go FredJ
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if u play a hero 4500 times and only win 52 out of 100 games then thats not normal
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							asking FredJ to play sf in a 1v1 and saying youre the bigger man because he dodged is like challenging stephen hawking to a fistfight and saying you're smarter than him because he dodged
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							JUST PLAY SF V WEAVER ITS WHATEVER AT THIS POINT
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							btw why do u only play weaver? im genuinely curious. its the first time ive interacted with a 1-hero person
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I just Randomed weaver thanks based FredJ,
Any tips for offlane play?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Go create a new account, all SF games, lemme know the % after 5k games. You obviously don't know much about distribution and statistics, you're prolly a math dropout. my 53% represents all of my games. And btw you know what's not normal? having sub 50% on sf and storm as your most played heroes.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,correction he's in high school. yes, i know. it explains everything
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yep math droupout here. and if u look at the last year most my winrantes are much high because i was Very Bad at dota and now im A little less bad.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							oh my god im in high school too nice nice
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							51% winrate over the past year
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ive applied to multiple middle schools will you write me a letter of recommendation Casey?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Correct me if I'm not mistaken, John Harwood, but that's lower than 52%
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							well its 53% if u loo kat only ranked and ignore LP but Yeah.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							and ur comparing my overall winrate to his 4500 games weaver winrate like good lord can ujust fuck off everything uve said so far is incorrect
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							My calculations returned 50% flat
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I compared ur shadow fiend winrate over the past 12 months: 51%,
ur shadow fiend winrate over the past 12 months in Ranked Matchmaking: 50%
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							like u dont even understand why 53% winrate on a hero uve played 4500 times is bad
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							don't mind me i'm just doing my best Carl Quintanilla impression
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							ive had 74 sf games in the past 12 months,
,
hes had 2000+ weaver games,
,
see the difference?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,u dont understand why it isn't tbh
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,yea thats actually better than normal
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yep thats about all the casey i can take for now ill be back later
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							It's not like I'm smurfing like you. My identity is clear from the start. People know what's coming, I'm playing vs counter picks left and right, by no mean I have even one friendly weaver game. Also, weaver is prolly bottom tier trash hero, it's not like I'm spamming 200 games of storm having a 48% winrate right?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							tk still thinks he's right,
,
his resilience is commendable tbqh
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I mean the only way to achieve over 50% winrate is to smurf, but given infinite games, you'll likely hit 50% eventually, no matter how good or bad you are, that's how mmr works.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,what the,
,
do u even know what smurfing is?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yeah ive picked storm in 4% of my games im such a storm spammer
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Just pulled your dotabuff accounts, that's all the names you used in the past 3 days, prolly even more.,
,
Ice ""Retard"" Frog	2 hours ago,
AUTISTIC MEEPO SP...	2 days ago,
ice ""Mentally Ret...	2 days ago,
Ice""Retard""Frog	3 days ago,
TK	3 days ago,
,
I mean I could easily improve my mmr changing my names left and right so the Weaver is always a surprise pick factor, but why bother, I'd rather win a challenging game.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							so changing my name is smurfing i see i see
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							FredJ's winning me over tbh
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							damn my strategy of changing my name to surprise opponents has been found out what do i do now
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Yeah you spammed him during the storm meta and then never touched him again, just like most of the heroes you play. You have no intrinsic skills. That's what I'm saying.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							exactly
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"

							,He was OP way before 6.84, he was just more popular in 6.84.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							alright im having trouble with this,

so i spamemd storm in the period which he was broken (which was everything prior to 6.85) to the point hwere he's indeed 4% of my games? can u confirm?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							alright i sent twitch an email fuck u notjones im unmodding u
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Holy shit fredj can communicate in English
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I mean your 4% represents all patch combined, lifetime account games.  It's obviously more than 4% during the 6.83-6.84 era.,
,
Also can you confirm that's the only account you ever played on? If not would you share all your smurfs accounts, because I can guarentee you, FredJ is the only dota 2 account I've even played on.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							im overflowing with intrinsic skill
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if u werent so entertaining id have left by now but,
,
6.83 happened in dec 2014 (less that a year ago) and i the last 12 months i have 92 stornm games which is 8% of my games,
,
keep going dude ill keep coming back
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,you sure have no intrinsic comedy value tho
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,As far as I know 8% is double the 4% you mentionned earlier.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							what can i say, it's intrinsic
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Meanwhile, you're dodging my 1v1 weaver vs sf or whatever game.

							,he legit bankrolled his clash of clans clanmates when they had to quit because of their crippling inability to spend money wisely kemal kinda owns
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							There was a price, however, for being the world’s premier Clasher. Part of it was measurable. To stay on top, Mr. Yao was spending at least $250 a week on the gems. By the time he had dominated the leader board for three months, he told me, he had sunk as much as $3,000 into Clash and was running out of money. He feared that he couldn’t keep up with wealthier rivals and threatened to quit.,
,
A clanmate in Turkey, the 38-year-old son of a business magnate who plays under the name Kemal, took pity on Mr. Yao and offered to become his sponsor, buying his gems. In return, Mr. Yao kept Kemal’s account active for him when Kemal was traveling and couldn’t play. But while that stopped Mr. Yao’s financial slide, it could not arrest a deeper erosion that his clanmates couldn’t see, the gradual way in which the game was swallowing Mr. Yao’s nonvirtual existence.

							i had fredj in my experiment of trying this awful game again,
,
we get an entire 5 man team ganking me in the offlane because im 6-0 and running town,
,
meanwhile he spends 22 minutes farming a naked linkens and doesnt farm another item in another 20.  with no ganks on him, not even someone contesting his lane.,
,
,
yeah these patches have just destroyed any semblance of this game requiring skill.  its just about farming on stupid shit and shitting out wins.  if you try to rotate and run the map if you aren't doing it as a team of 5 you will just eventually feed 1 death with 1k gold and 3 levels along with it and the other team is automatically caught up.,

							,You can tell Legato thinks he's some kind of do shit, play any role, underpowered/unpopular hero picking, cerebral player like Universe or KZZ and has rationalized that the only reason he's still 4k after playing DotA for 10+ years is because he randoms and doesn't spam heroes or play core only. Like you have to have a certain level of delusion to unironically say shit like ""I assume everyone else sux at this hero because nobody actually knows how to play [earthshaker]"" while smugly implying that you are one of the few enlightened that does know. Good god kill yourself.

I could have picked another hero, but no one else went mid so I did I would have played anything.

							when you get a couple of bad games and u rage and say some racial slurs. Then after the game ends you have this odd feeling that was bad so you test whether you are muted or not. You are not, but still you have the weird feeling. ,
You queue. ,
Game Loads, you notice ""Slithereen"" is on your team. Game starts he does that its safe to leave bullshit cuz ppl are picking kunka and mirana vs some op bullshit. Slithereen picks pudge and proceeds to feed. ,

there's actually something wrong with ppl that pick heroes that basically puts their team into a miserable situation and yet respond to ppl being frustrated with ""CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE""
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Did he pick riki?
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							lol,
,
y,know that riki topic wasn't about it being a good or bad hero,
,
it was about everyone that spams that hero never communicating with their team and running around like a retard
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I mean one thing is being frustrated which is understandable in that situation, but if you were an unbearable fuck to him because you were frustrated, then I can understand him saying that.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Cause honestly he's not the greatest player for his MMR, but he's not a bad guy as far as Peruvians go iirc
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							people who complain about picks from the outset are pretty unbearable though unless you really pick your team into a corner.  like randoming clinkz when you have all your cores already.  or some other example where you're doomed to contribute nothing and make everyone lose.  people who are just prejudiced against specific heroes and think they suck and don't shut the fuck up about it for 30 minutes need to be muted permanently though
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i actually understand if godzhand wants to pick some other shit,
,
If i pick random shit in my games the low mmr players always fucking complain, WHY 6K GOES RANDOM HERO NOW WE LOST just because were the highest mmr doesnt mean we want to play the same mid heros every fucking game and solo carry the fucking game
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							stop thoughing your thoughts
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,disagree ,
,
if ur picking naix at any point of the draft i think u need to get shot in the face
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							same with natures prophet, axe, elder titan, techies, puck, od
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							IMO if you're one of those people who chimps out on someone for picking offlane Axe second or third pick, that's on you asshole
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i dont rage at people for picks,
,
,
but im saying if you pick garbage heroes and someone calls you a dumbfuck retard, you deserve it
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Eh, I disagree, unless they're actually bad at the hero too,
,
usually if someone picks ET or Puck or whatever at 6k+, it means they're confident with the hero and have a shitton of games played with it, so I don't judge
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							is that ever, honestly ever the case? someone that's a high mmr/highly skilled picking an unusual/out-of-meta hero? (logonbupt doesnt count, he's a god among mere mortals),
,
,
it's always someone thats like high 4k in a 6k+ avg game balancing out the mmr of the 7k player that randoms immediately/picks some dumb hero after heroes have been established
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							It's a mixed bag, I know there's that Timber spammer who was over 6k last time I played with him, I'd rather he pick Timber than Earth Spirit or whatever if he knows how to play one really well but not the other,
,
I know the 4k's you're talking about though, those are real rough cause if they picked Slardar or Wyvern they'd at least be somewhat useful
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,naix owns and i will stand by this and it has nothing to do with that stupid ancients shit
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							if u pick a hero that makes it really hard for ur 4 random teammates to enjoy their game and just respond to ppl hvaing a reason to be annoyed with LOL WHO CARES!!! CHANGE UR ATTITUDE!,
,
then you're just being an asshole,
,
i'm not saying that complaining is a good thing. i'm sure i'm a whining asshole as well.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							the low mmrs are usually the ones who random because they don't want to support, it's not the same as the people who are just good at heroes that aren't meta and manage to have an impact anyway.  i have seen some remarkably good OD/veno players lately
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							nah I was talkin about picking antimage when they already have tiny + wisp and a brood,
,
Idc if someone picks some non meta shit,
,
but if u put ur team in a 4v5 situation whent he game is already rough and then act holier than thou when ppl are frustrated COME ON MAN LOL what do you expect! WTF???
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							conversely i've seen people pick shit like io and winter wyvern and then immediately say ""i have no idea how to play this hero"" they then proceed to shit all over their team and lose the game
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,yeah ok you have my blessing to complain in that scenario.  accomplishes nothing but maybe it alleviates boredom
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							saying naix owns is like saying stalin was misunderstood and actually a pretty cool guy
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							didnt stalin resurrect a dead country or was that lenin
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Stalin was a badass when he was younger tbh. He robbed banks and ran underground bolshevik forces
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							honestly od isnt that bad right now, when theres triple strength cores on the other team or whatever he does a fair bit of work
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"

						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I lost like 300mmr during last two weeks, my hidden estimated mmr valve so low so I am getting matched with 4ks now,
,
some highlights,
, dotabuff plus, do twitch streaming, lost us a game singlehandley by going 0-9-0 offlane solo pudge that he asked for and do griefing entire game after,
, peruvian named ""4k please don't go mid"" then go mid as sf vs qop 0-7-1,
and there was mvp sunbhie of course I love his voice saying ""it is okay you go feed enemy but don't fucking be a PUSSY"",
countless number of peruvian ragers who suddenly become angry for no reason then throw unthrowable game,
countless number of useless as fuck 'supports' doing fucking nothing but walking around entire game,

I should quit
						"

if ur any high 5k or 6k+ on us server u basically got 4ks every other game unless u only que a) afer high mmr games end b) during peak hours
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,Ye I only play at peak hours to avoid that situation since I play WW, usually avg 5.6 to 6k+ but now it dropped to around avg 5.2 game quality socks so much I don't even want to queue
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							yea u need a mid hero in ur hero pool to stay sane for that shit
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,I wholeheartedly agree
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							Just had a scepter euls on a 5 position wr in 30 mins but my team still lost us the game xD

						"

							FUCK MITHRANDIR,
HOW DO YOU GO 1-8-0 ON BOUNTY HUNTER,
,
hoenstly if i ever get a support player who doesnt run around on bad/braindead heroes and do nothing the entire game ill throw ihm a parade
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							There's a lack of true support players, most are cores and play support because they are forced to. That's prolly why true supports have no problems climbing to 6k+.
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							,-Signed, i'm a fuck that only plays weaver. i've only played two heroes, both with invis in my last 100 games AMA.,
,
,
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							He played a Slark game two days ago and didn't even buy SB though
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							i feel like almost all of the supports ive gotten lately are just doing this thing where they just sit behind me within exp range but make no attempt to harass their offlane or do anything other than fuck up the occasional creep kill and leech exp.  its like i suggest to them to walk up and harass their offlaner or to leave and stack but it just goes completely over their head.  then they start flaming 10 min later and blaming everyone else
						"
title default,link default,user default,"
							I had a warlock just buy wards and run up to enemy cores and die in 3 hits.  He left the lane after level 1 and stacked the jungle all day, just so enemy SF could steal it all while the others were too busy being complete idiots.  He was level 6 by the time enemy SF was 16..sincerely asking what he was doing wrong.  MMR inflation is peaking
						"
title default,link default,user default,"

						"

kind of like a ned flanders type that plays dota

						"
