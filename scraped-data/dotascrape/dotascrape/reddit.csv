Also, no one falls for mines at the entrances to the Side Shop; its too obvious, right? You can play both of these preconceptions to your advantage. What you do is buy , TP scrolls, teleport to the lane you will , be occupying, plant 7 mines (enough to kill most heroes, but 8 if you want the full 4-mine equivalent from the pre-nerf Techies) in the Side Shop entrance facing the enemy tower, then when you are done, teleport to the lane you , be occupying and run into the Side Shop in , lane. If you were fast enough, you should be able to bluff coming out of the Side Shop in full vision of your enemies, and they will think they know where the mines are. In reality, they are not even in that lane. No one expects mines in the lane the Techies is not even in during the early game. ",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v9lfm/so_has_anybody_found_a_way_to_play_techies_yet/,TheGreatGimmick,"After you do all that, you set about doing Techies things in lane while waiting for your first blood gold. Whether you focus on farming or mining depends on your lane partner, but you should never spend more than a few moments at a time mining during the early game. Firstly, you need experience. Secondly, a missing techies is a mining techies, and enemies know that. Thirdly, too many mines in the wrong place can net a nice chunk of cash for a smart enemy support. So, generally minimize your time spent mining in the early game. When the creep wave pushes up, take that moment of being out of enemy vision to plant one or at max two mines off to the side, preferably near the entrances to the lane, but then follow the wave to farm or at least show yourself. If your lane partner needs farm you are focused on defense, if not, you are focused on creeps. ",,,,

I know some swear by leaving Suicide at level 1 for the mana cost, but it is just too strong to pass on I feel. Often my third skill point is spent on Suicide instead of Landmines (1-0-2-0 at level 3), anticipating needing to use it in the near future. Between the threat of Suicide and Landmines, the lane should be pretty safe for you and your partner from the psychological barrier alone, but if you are challenged, not only can you not die unless you are chain-stunned perfectly, but also incoming gankers are likely to die from landmines. A tip on Suicide: The short radius damage is far stronger, yes, but don't be afraid to utilize the long radius damage to catch enemies off guard or secure a fleeing kill. It has deceptively long range and is still quite deadly. ",,,,

Then I get Bottle and Arcane Boots (the boots are sooo efficient if you drop them before using Soul Ring, just make sure there are no enemies nearby, especially invisible ones) (I get Bottle mainly because a Techies will often find himself back in base, either from Suicide or just spending so much mana).

He plays as a greedy 4 position, but from about level 8 he can provide so much vision with mines that your other support can place fewer wards if needed.

By this I mean any form of negative communication, up to some extent.

What you will often see is that players will react to these mistakes by either; just plainly throwing swearwords towards this player or by a combination between swearwords, this should be clear, and a more ‘play-based’ negative reaction. The latter would for example be: “You fucking noob, why the hell did u buy a fucking Midas on AM”. So this is clearly without explanation of the view why it is bad. I am not trying to say that everyone behaves in this pattern nor that everyone is inclined to have a negative attitude towards other players, especially when they make mistakes, I am just trying to cover these kind of situations. Let us presume the game continues and more negativity arises, because team A is behind and the supports in the team hardly have the time, space nor the opportunity to place wards. Then someone gets picked of and instantly shouts that there are no wards and that the support should be reported because he is not doing his job. After the tides turn somewhat, what I usually see happen is that, the ones who were throwing swearwords at each other stay silent or are being more positive towards each other. Then, when team A is pushing the opponent’s base, team A lose a fight and lose the game. The game ends, of course, with the same attitude as was displayed while being behind.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"I think this is a situation in which most players who have played DotA, not substantially, but somewhat, are familiar with. For me one of the main things that stands out when I reflect on these kind of matches is the fact that, when you are behind, players are more inclined to notice mistakes of other players and are eager to point the finger as much to other players as they can. (This is the reason I chose a ranked game for the example, since this also has an influence on players their motivation to win.) From all my experiences in DotA I think I can say that there is definitely a difference in attitude when you are behind or when you are ahead, not statistically but rather how the game feels to be going. As you can see in the example, the ‘fighting’ and disharmony in the team settles, it is not gone completely, but the fact that it feels like they are able to win again makes them, in some cases, friendlier towards each other. A logical conclusion to draw from the fact that players are behaving more positively towards other players when they feel they are ahead, is that they are becoming more frustrated once they feel like they are losing, which is a kind of logical reaction. However, I think there is no moral justification to behave towards other players as I described in the example and I will explain this a bit more later on.  ",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"A point that should be mentioned is that the ‘negative behaviour’ towards other players is, most of the times, not based on aspects of the game but solely on the players itself. So when, for instance, it doesn’t go well, as I said before, payers will just throw swearwords at the player they find is faulty. I do not wish to throw everything onto the same boat, because surely there are different ways to have a negative attitude towards another player. As I just mentioned players will just insult other people without mentioning aspects of the game, other will try and criticize players using aspects of the game. For me they are both wrong. One might say: “Certainly there should be a difference between the two, since a player having a ‘some-what’ negative attitude towards another player while still keeping to aspects of the game as his main way of ascribing his negativity, is different from the one just insulting the other.” This I will get to a bit later.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"So, in short, it seems that there are players who do not really consider any aspect of the game when they feel a player is faulty instead they just get frustrated and, maybe, forget about the aspects of the game that is crucial, instead they just attack a player personally. I believe that this behaviour originates from their views and knowledge of the game. The terms: views and knowledge mean their insight in the mechanics of the game. When we conclude it actually does arise from happenings in the game, why do people tend to attack someone personally, since they are clearly two different things? I think this has to do with very many things, first of all there is the internet factor. ",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"Internet is a social environment without any form of social control, basically people can act how they like without feeling any kind of guilt or without other people confronting them about their behaviour. The latter I have done a lot of times and because it is on the internet, most players, do not really care. Of course anonymity also plays its part in people being able to refuse to follow any kind of ‘social rules’. In my opinion this is a very important and unsettling notion, the fact that one would not consider his behaviour on the internet just shows very low moral standards. It are still other people one is playing with/against. This might formulate my view that interactions in DotA do not have anything to do with DotA, besides the fact that it is happening in the DotA client and, for that reason, the subject matter will probably be mostly DotA. ",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"The reason I am stating this is because I see players responding with: “It’s just a game”, after I explain that such behaviour is a form of bad conduct. So my answer to this would be, no, the players you are insulting are people, for that reason it has nothing to do with DotA except the fact that it is happening in DotA. To make this clearer I will try using an example. Let’s say you play football every Saturday and this Saturday you are having a horrible match because one of your teammates keeps losing the ball. As a response to this you start shouting at him, maybe saying some stuff about his family or even telling him to die/uninstall (this part is open to imagination) and when the coach gets you off the field and reprimands you because of your behaviour, you say, as I have seen happen in DotA, “it’s just a game”. It should be obvious that this is no justification for behaviour of the sort and that it actually has nothing to do with football, except for it happening while playing football, and everything to do with the interaction between ‘players’.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"Another example is that players try to justify their negative behaviour by saying it are the other players who are at fault, “So I am justified by insulting and verbally harassing other players”.
I think the fact remains that this is the case (as in, it’s a fact that players reason like this), it is however very wrong to do so.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"Another reason why I think people tend to attack someone personally, as I have stated earlier, comes from the frustration that goes with losing. It is more subtle than just frustration from losing, it’s rather not wanting to feel frustration on the fact that ‘you’ yourself are losing and that this might be your doing. As a reflex to this notion players tend to point the finger towards other people. And yes, the player you are pointing the finger towards might have made a mistake. There is, however, a big difference between explaining what a player did wrong or something in the sense of feedback, or using the mistake or general performance as the reason ‘your team’ lost and/or why, the one using this, was not the cause of this in any form. This is a very simple approach which, as I believe, has two very indistinct sides to it, which, of course, I will try to explain using an example. (1) DotA, like anything really, has a very complex causal chain of events (e.g. doing something right could have the worst possible outcome and vice-versa) (2) One can only actively change one’s own doing.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"Let us consider (1), when any player makes a decision it is based on, I guess, memory of games played before and general play-style, knowledge of the game, this could be effected by an (maybe) infinite amount of other things. Another thing which is closely related is the fact that people, very easily, judge someone as a player. It will happen that one player tells another player that he is bad etc. Though this might be true it is never an individual player that makes up the game. So the fact that a certain player might not be performing so well could be the fact that his playstyle just doesn’t work out in this match. It could also be that previous matches made him make some faulty assumptions, or that some items he bought are in general good but how the game works out just doesn’t suit them. I am trying to point out that there are an uncountable reasons why one loses or wins and sometimes. So, when one says that a certain decision is wrong, one cannot begin to understand why what happened actually happened, one can only make an assumption. And again, this assumption could be accurate or not, we can’t know. This might seem counter-intuitive, since the game has a certain meta and since we interpret different aspects of the game as gaining understanding of how it works, yet, as I believe, doing something well could be the cause of your losing the game and doing something wrong or ‘bad’ the opposite. This is so in specific decision making situations and, probably, on individual level. Since doing worse than the other team as a team, continuously, will probably lose you the game.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"The second notion is, for all I know, fact. A person can only actively change one’s own behaviour. We cannot by any means control someone else, like we control ourselves. Once this realisation dawns it should be obvious that being behaving negatively, as previously described, is no means of changing the situation. Of course there are ways of influencing other people. So, let us suppose we want someone to communicate that someone is missing. Obviously we can only achieve this by communicating this to the other player, but it will do no good if this communication is purely based on blaming the other player for a death caused by rotating player of the other team. It could still happen that ‘you’ communicated that you would be grateful if player A called ‘miss’ and player A still refuses to do so. (A player doing this in such a polite fashion is already highly unlikely, since mostly one will see a mad comment about miss not being called, thus blaming the player in question for one’s own death.) Once this happens it is the realisation that one cannot change someone else should be enough to refrain from negative behaviour to player A. In short, negative behaviour is never justified nor effective since one can only change his/her own behaviour. Therefore should the focus lie on one’s own behaviour and everything else related to the game which you, as a player, have an influence on.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"When we tie (1) and (2) together we come to the conclusion that it is extreme difficult to decide whether a certain decision is correct or incorrect and even if we could, we cannot simply change another player. Hence, a player should focus on playing his best, since there is no better way to decide whether you win or not. (This includes things as the use of positive reinforcement to try and help teammates out when a certain meta-question arises, maybe we can call this ‘being his/her best’.) I also think that this makes DotA more fun to play in general and for everyone. 
This, I think, is fairly obvious and doesn’t have to be explain in detail.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"I have declared most of the things that I have encountered and tried to explain in somewhat detail why I think certain behaviour arises. In the next part I will try and look at some of the things I stated and make some suggestion on how to be able to change these aspects of thinking, so that DotA becomes a friendlier place. I do want to mention that I feel like a lot of the attitudes mentioned are changeable, they are however based on very fundamental views on social interactions. So in order for one to be able to change one’s behaviour one most change a fundamental view on these social interactions.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"The first ‘fundamental view’ is to accept that the fact that the social interaction that takes place on the internet is not fundamentally different from any other non-virtual social interaction, because it is still just interaction from person to person/player to player. Accept that, as a player, one is playing with other people who have feelings and are influenced by what you say and that one should always take these in great consideration. I know this is a personal view, I will later mention why, if u do not really care about other people’s feelings, you should still be wanting to take them in to consideration.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"Secondly, this is something that is, to me, a general insight in life: accept the fact that you have no control over someone else and should therefore focus more on your own playing/decision making, than someone else’s. By doing this one will get to the conclusion that harassing someone verbally has no use, since one cannot change the other player. When the intention of the harassment is to change another player’s behaviour, this is the wrong way to go at it. A ‘fact’, at least I believe it to be true, is that, when one start behaving negatively, as described here and there, you lower you chance of winning. This has to do with general morale and team spirit, along with some other things. ",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"Thirdly, I want to presuppose the fact that I think most negative behaviour and negativity arises from the fact that people are frustrated by losing. I briefly mentioned this before. When we look at this statement it seems very odd indeed. To explain this consider the following: Since it became popular for online team-based competitive games to have an online ranking and matchmaking, there has been a lot of fuss about the general attitude in these matches. This is also the reason that most games have implemented ways to report players, together with a kind of system of social rules which are to be followed. These same game-organisations use statistics evidence that show that player A, who has a tendency to have a negative attitude, loses more games. Now, if ‘most’, negative attitude arise from the fact that people are frustrated by losing or the thought of the incoming loss, because players want to win, the players in question are causing their own demise. (One can also conclude that, since the statistics show that in matches in which players flame on each other most loses occur, people will flame when they lose. This would mean that you do not really lose more matches, but just that when a team loses they tend to flame more. I still believe flaming or any form of negative attitude lowers the chance of a team winning the game.) ",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbob3/an_essay_on_general_negative_behaviour_in_dota/,,"Last but not least, even if you do not care about your social behaviour and the ethical aspects that go with it, nor about the other players their feelings, there is still a reason to refrain from behaving as mentioned, since it will just lower your chances of winning all together and it seems that this is the main reason this kind of behaviour arises.",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3va5yy/greater_urn_of_shadows/,,The idea for this item comes from the recent talk about having ways to deal with evasion. The approach here is to create a cheapish (less than 2000 gold) support item which works against evasion but does not completely negate it.,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3va5yy/greater_urn_of_shadows/,,: Urn of Shadows + Staff of Wizardry,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3va5yy/greater_urn_of_shadows/,,": +10 Intelligence, +6 Strength, +50% Mana regen",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3va5yy/greater_urn_of_shadows/,,: Stays the same as Urn except for the following: When used on an ally also restores 100 mana. When used on an enemy reduces their evasion by 20% for the duration.,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3va5yy/greater_urn_of_shadows/,,"Urn is a great support and ganking item that is usually bought because it provides a bit of mana regen an a bit of hp, along with it's Soul Release being a good ability. I built on that in deciding which item to use in the upgrade recipe. Other options would be to use Ogre Club or one of the boosters. The upgrade to Soul Release on an ally makes it not a worthless item even when enemies aren't building evasion and I think is great for heros that have a bit more mana trouble but don't want to or can't afford going into a bigger item with mana regen such as euls or orchid. I like the extra int because it could possibly offset the need for arcane boots and open up the option for phase or tranquils  on more heros.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3va5yy/greater_urn_of_shadows/,,"When used on an enemy the ability now lowers their evasion, e.g. if they had a Solar Crest their evasion would be lowered from 25% to 5%. The 20% figure is just a guess. 20% makes it quite strong against Radiance and Solar Crest but not too strong against PA (and pretty useless against Windrun). I think this number would have to be at least 15% for it to be useful. Another option is for it to halve the evasion, which makes it weaker against Radiance and Solar Crest, but makes it stronger against PA. I am also inclined to think that the damage (not the heal) should be bumped up a bit, maybe to 200.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3va5yy/greater_urn_of_shadows/,Gozujohn2k,Why the hell are people so overly obsessed with evasion? Finally we get to see MKB being build after being nearly declared the most underutilized item because evasion was only available for PA and Windranger and Radiance which is so low that it hardly matters.,,,,

The only thing Jakiro does not offer is heals and buffs, but who the fuck needs those when the enemies are all scorched and thawed? He is also pretty easy to farm as. One lvl 4 Dual Breath guarantees a ranged creep kill and melee creep kills too if your creeps attack at right times. I actually have taken into habit to max Dual Breath over Liquid Fire if the lane is aggressive, works wonders. If I ever get Octarine Core on the Hero, the game is pretty much over. A 6,7 second cooldown AoE stun, a ~7 second cd DoT which deals 400 damage and you can use Liquid Fire on two cores at once! Like holy shit. Also coupled with Aghs, your ult only has ~33% downtime. Enough jizzing over Jakiro for now, I need to stop here.",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vb9q5/valve_what_is_actually_intended_with_cliffing/,,"Why are Dark Seer and Rubick's cliffing abilities so peculiar? It feels like the cliff-prevention rules that were applied to them are just really poorly thought-out, ineffective, and should definitely have been revisited when the map was updated (twice - the Roshan move and Reborn). I feel like cliffing should either be obvious or impossible, but instead it's only available to people who know weirdly specific pixels to vacuum/levitate people to, or which cliffs are marked as illegal and which aren't.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vb9q5/valve_what_is_actually_intended_with_cliffing/,,"Why are Pudge and Venge singled out for free pathing when they have probably the least threatening cliffing abilities (seriously, how often did you see this happen with a force staff before the blink change)? If it's because they can do it to allies, why isn't the free pathing limited to allies? Why isn't it applied to Io's Relocate?",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vb9q5/valve_what_is_actually_intended_with_cliffing/,,side thought: I think maybe there should just be automatic free pathing for anyone who's stuck on a cliff/in trees for 2 minutes. I think 99% of these cases are people who are new to the game and don't know any of the ways to get out of it and there's no real value in punishing these players any more than they've already punished themselves by choosing to learn dota. I know there's certain cases where perfectly competent players can get cliffed for a long time but those are kind of stupid and two minutes is an eternity anyways. ,,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v3iqi/item_suggestion_tjins_bucket/,FoundersDiscount,"This is fucking brilliant; And actually very clever and efficient from a design perspective.  When I first started playing dota I thought a water themed hero might move faster in the river or something. I still think  that would be a cool mechanic. But having played more I realized it would create a weird water meta. This, however I feel is an awesome and super interesting way to incorporate the map into additional gameplay. Using assets that have been staring at you in the face all day. As a design enthusiast I imagine SOMEONE at valve feels stupid right now and/or utterly flabbergasted. Like, I want this to be messed around with. You make me want this crazy thing. Someone custom game this shit or something.",,,,

While I get why you would go Mjollnir for the extra attack speed while you are already farming fast with Radiance, I believe that a Moonshard would have been more useful. Either that or more of a damage item such as basher. I personally don't think that the best way to build Alchemist is the radiance build (depending what type of team your are against). I believe that the better Alchemist build (for at least the rest of 6.85) is , This is not the official build, but you can watch his Alchemist games from Frankfurt if you want to try to understand the build the way that he created it.",,,,

The big factor for Storm is his mana pool early game. This would allow him to zipzap anywhere with an early aghas and mana boots. :(,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3varei/storm_spirit_aghanims_sceptre_upgrade/,Gryphon4,"Early Aghs?  If you are getting Aghs first, you are skipping Bloodstone and Orchid.  His mana pool will still be awful.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3varei/storm_spirit_aghanims_sceptre_upgrade/,AdzR,If you had the option of that aghas and considering the bloodstone nerf would you not get it early? ,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3varei/storm_spirit_aghanims_sceptre_upgrade/,Gryphon4,"It depends on the game.  Bloodstone is a snowball item; if you have a Tusk/Spirit Breaker on your team, then you will likely be doing a lot of ganking and as a result get a lot of Bloodstone charges.  On the other hand, if the enemy team has Silencer/Anti-Mage, then you will likely die a lot and have a hard time maintaining your charges.  In the first scenario, Bloodstone gives a huge return on investment.  In the second, however, it ends up being a waste of gold.  That is when you buy Aghs instead.",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3varei/storm_spirit_aghanims_sceptre_upgrade/,Gryphon4,"The point of this upgrade it to give Storm a less risky alternative to Bloodstone.  Bloodstone still has the potential to give far more mana if Storm can snowball, but Aghs is a safer choice if you feel that you won't be getting many charges or are afraid that you will die frequently and lose them.

Even if the item excited I don't see myself getting it. The build up and base stats on the item are pretty pathetic for storm.

The benefits of this item is endless.

By removing a javelin from the components, we now make the item less strong when mini-bashed.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v9iw8/item_balancing_a_rework_remake_and_equalizing_the/,,"With this slight change, we make MKB somewhat similar, but at the same time more accessible, due to not needing to farm more to get the usual +1 javelin, but instead buying 1 Quarterstaff at a time.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v9iw8/item_balancing_a_rework_remake_and_equalizing_the/,,"First of all, the flaw in Butterfly was the price. Among the three stat luxury items (Scythe of Vyse, Heart of Tarrasque, Butterfly), it costs THE MOST, while providing the least (stat wise). It is the 5th most expensive item in the game. Every hero should get a heart/hex, but not every hero should build a butterfly, and lets not forget that its countered by the item above.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v9iw8/item_balancing_a_rework_remake_and_equalizing_the/,,"Secondly, it is heavily countered and inefficient. It I need good agi stats, I can get Manta, it provides good utility AND fight power. If I need evasion, I can rely on support who can get Solar Crest, it even gives more armor! If I want damage, well, tons of items give more damage. If I want attack speed, Mjolnir provides more than double of it AND teamfight potential. Overall, the current Butterfly feels, 'lacking'. While most of you guys would argue that there are no item that provides as many positive bonuses, it is still not worth it for that price for such minimal amount.",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v9iw8/item_balancing_a_rework_remake_and_equalizing_the/,,"With this item introduced, we balanced out the usage between Sange and Yasha. As you can see, Gorudo is similarly a poor man Butterfly. However, with the reduced stats, I have tried to balance the effect of it, as well as added a debuff for negative slows. Meaning if I activate 'Dart' while under the effects of 'Void', or Battle Hunger/Poison Sting, or even Stiffling Dagger, it will remove the slow (for skills that do DoT, it will remove the slow but not damage, does not work on constant slows like Rot or Upheavel). This will give the effect more utility, as well as a good replacement for Butterfly.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v9iw8/item_balancing_a_rework_remake_and_equalizing_the/,,"Now I'll move on back to Butterfly. To reintoduce Butterfly, I thought of a way where any hero, regardless of stats, can get the item. It'll be similar to Heart or Hex, where it is always a good item to consider, always situational, and most of the time game-changing as well. I want Butterfly to have that effect, while maintaining its concept of an agile and dexterity item, as well as a luxurious late game item that is game changing.",,,,

I will justify it by saying Diffusal counters almost all heroes in the game. The reasoning for granting the new Butterfly is to provide more mobility, as well as more late game potential. The new Flutter is essentially the same, but without the drawback of losing the evasion, which is what i've removed entirely. But by doing so, I've added the new invisibility which works slightly abit like Windrun, but with Invisibility as well. But i'll hold onto my explanation 1st.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v9iw8/item_balancing_a_rework_remake_and_equalizing_the/,,"Lets start with the cost. It has been significantly increased, from the previous 5875 to 6100.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v9iw8/item_balancing_a_rework_remake_and_equalizing_the/,,"But what makes the new Butterfly better is the new Flutter effect as mentioned.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vb8tp/mangos_aghanim_upgrade/,,"
When a mango receives an Aghanim's scepter it will turn into spawnable non-controllable tower at target location with following functions.,
 * At random intervals between 30 seconds and 90 seconds, the Mango tower launches a mango at every allied hero in a global range. If there is an empty slot it puts a mango in its inventory. If no slots are available then 100 mana is restored to the hero instead of the mango.,
* Mangoes given to heroes have the same properties as a mango bought from the store and can be sold just like a normal mango.,
* Mango tower gives a passive 1 health per second regeneration in a 1000 unit radius.,
* Hero attacks to destroy mango tower 10.,
* Non hero attacks to destroy mango tower 322.,
* Mango tower can be seen through fog of war every time it releases mangoes.
* Heroes can cast tp onto Mango tower  ",,,,

, can feed Mango tower to any hero giving them the functions of a mango tower but mango launching will cease for the duration of the death timer.,
, , can use mango tower as a remnant.,
, with an Aghanim's scepter of his own can assimilate mango tower and permanently possess mango tower properties.,
, with an Aghanim's scepter can replicate a fully functional mango tower and can hybrid with it to fully become a mango tower.,
, can cast spell steal on mango tower and gain effects of mango tower for the duration of spell steal or until another spell is stolen.,
, with an Aghanim's scepter of his own can sit in the pocket of mango tower giving full effects of riki's scepter to the tower.,
, with an Aghanim's scepter of its own can lift mango tower using all three familiars turning it in to one unit with improved stats and unlimited attack bonus charges.  ",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vacmo/reborn_equipped_items_not_showing_up_ingame/,,"Is anyone else having this issue? I'll go into my armory and equip a courier / HUD / Announcer. When I get in-game? Nothing. None of my items are there. Just equipped Shagbark in my armory, launched a ranked game, purchased the courier (because I'm that type of guy) and......donkey. I click on the little icon in the top left that shows what items you can use, and I see other players' items, but nothing is there for me. I went back after the game and double checked, my items ARE equipped in the armory. I don't want this to be a Reborn hate fest. However, this UI looks incredible but it's fucking ridiculously confusing and non-intuitive. No ""Store Front"" tab (which drives me the most crazy) but I'm getting off topic. I've been playing Dota for years, and here I am again asking for help with the UI. Pls volvo.",,,,

All right, I think many people are waiting for me to comment. I haven't been mistaken yet in situations that involve myself. It is the same this time =) It was my the most successful team and I wanted to stay with them. But to regret about something or to think about how something could have been is not for me. I'll continue to move forward as I've always did. I do not consider myself better or worse than someone else. I'll continue to improve and I'll not compare myself to anyone. There is only one thing I ask: do not blame the guys who made this decision. Give them time and they will show themself, be tolerate. I had quite a lot of drawbacks they didn't want to put up with, that's all. All this was done right and for greater results. The life and the following matches will tell. Do not blame people for opting for hopes for the best.  ",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v4dow/silent_to_replace_illidan_in_virtuspro/,Ice_Cream_Warrior,"Hope this means some more success for VP. A lot of people think Illidan worked well and meant they could play other heroes (silencer, venge, drow, weaver) but the more you watched their games and not just one offs the more it kind of seems that if they had drafted more to meta and had their 1 position hero farming at +500gpm every game they probably would've won more. Its hard to tell how much of this playstyle is the teams direction or Illidan's own personal style (wanting these heroes and not farming) and it did seem they would sacrifice his farm and protection for both G's and lil's sometimes. Illidan would often turn into the 3rd hero on the farm chart and be almost a support hero in the late game to help out G as the main core and one of Lil or DK on a playmaker/burst damage hero. His laning presence still seemed not fantastic, especially when they did adequately support him, and it just seemed that his lack of playing more normal 1 position heroes really then made late games very hard for VP if they didn't snowball to wins in 25 mins. His late game play also seems somewhat mechanically lacking (out of position a lot, too slow on bkbs etc) and it will be interesting to see how VP plays with a different core. I think Illidan was much stronger and very important in their play pre-Ti5 to establish them as a top 10 team, and then their run into Ti5 and getting them a top 6 finish TI. Hope he finds success, but as a fan of the team more-so than specifically Illidan, I think this change instantly improves them and hope that Silent can rejuvenate the team out of their kinda post ti slump.",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vayc3/how_is_snowball_even_fair/,,"The ability to dodge all forms of damamge and basically be removed from the map is just stupid. There is no way to even counter it other than already be beating the enemy or focus tusk in the fight before he uses it. But I could deal with it if it was just that. However I feel as if it ruins the entertainment factor of watching the game. It isn't a huge clutch play that saves the day its a low skill ceiling play that even people at 3k MMR can do! The only difference from the pros doing it? They do it slightly faster than a pubbie could do. It's like puck could make his team mates phase out of the map like he can however that would only be 3.25 seconds while tusk can delay damage for a total of 3 seconds priming phase and up to 3 seconds chasing phase. PLEASE CHANGE THIS! I'm so sick of this corny ""LOL I'M IN A SNOWBALL CAN'T HURT ME NOW"" plays. At the very least reduce AoE Damage in half when in the snowball. ",,,,

Once again ill tell you, I honestly dont give a fuck if you want to voice your opinions, i really dont. the last thing on my mind is you and your opinions. i just hopped in and said that the patch is coming very very soon and that it would be better to complain afterwords. because you asked.

Why I can't answer though because you have no ground to stand on. Tweaking the time on snowball or adding 50% reduction damage while in snow ball would of been a small balance change. Also knowing valves reputation of always working on a game to the last minute they are probably still evaluating balances changes to the game up until the last few days.

You have teleportation scrolls but you use them to get to lanes as far away from danger as possible and push. You tell your team to fight under tower. You tell your team not to come to your lane.

This does not mean ""the wolf fights""; it means that the wolf go split push. You are on a lane preferably furthest away from danger. You are in the jungle or at the ancients farming. You are at roshan getting that aegis timing that shit. You get necro 1, 2, 3. You upgrade your brown boots into boots of travel. You do it in this exact order. You keep that split push going. You smoke rosh whenever he's up. You keep telling your team not to be with you or come to your lanes. You are Lycan. You are nice about it. You are split push. You are objectives. You are win.

Also, always judge your fights. Do not be too much of a pussy or too brave. It will only get you killed, or your rax taken.

You tell your team that you will split push. You do this in a nice way because you are Lycan picker and you want to win. You buy stout, quelling, tangoes in that exact order. You go jungle. You get: level 7, 4-0-2-1 skill build. You have: vlads, quelling, stout, smoke. You smoke and take rosh before 10 minutes. You time that motherfucker. You buy brown boots. You go push a lane or take ancients if there is no safe lane to push. You repeat until game is won. You never fight with your team ever. You never fight without your team ever. Wolves need no armour. Why do wolves need no armour you may ask? Wolves need no armour because wolves never fight; wolves split push. This is why wolves need no armour. Your team dying 4 mid? You do not fight with them. You do not teleport to them. You do not flame them. You are Lycan and you want to win. You have teleportation scrolls but you use them to get to lanes as far away from danger as possible and push. You tell your team to fight under tower. You tell your team not to come to your lane. You do this in a nice way because even though wolves need no armour wolves want to win games. If you are getting ganked (you should be looking at the mini map and not be in a situation where you’re getting ganked) but if you are getting ganked you know what to do: you listen to Lycan and Lycan tells you what? That’s right you sonofabitch: Lycan tells you that ""the wolf runs"". You pop that ultimate, you back off and you TP out. You push another lane or you farm jungle/farm ancients/smoke roshan. If you don't know what to do then what do you do? That's right; you listen to Lycan again and Lycan tells you that ""the wolf runs"" and that ""wolves need no armour"". This does not mean ""the wolf fights""; it means that the wolf go split push. You are on a lane preferably furthest away from danger. You are in the jungle or at the ancients farming. You are at roshan getting that aegis timing that shit. You get necro 1, 2, 3. You upgrade your brown boots into boots of travel. You do it in this exact order. You keep that split push going. You smoke rosh whenever he's up. You keep telling your team not to be with you or come to your lanes. You are Lycan. You are nice about it. You are split push. You are objectives. You are win. You remember that ""wolves love to battle"" against structures because then wolves will need no armour and wolves can run in circles around the structures. You never fight. You end the game with 0-0-0 and the highest building damage ever conceived by man.",,,,

Having a starting HP of 600 and being long ranged is all he has going for him in the very early laning phase. On the upside he's basically ""Rune contesting: The hero"", good luck trying to solo contest him, you either get fucked by flux(which slows by 50% and deals dmg over time) or he can just ""mine"" the runespot with sparkwraiths without even leaving the lane, they're visible but it's not like you can do anything about it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v6q4c/valve_plz_hear_community_no_more_solo_x_party/,tha-Ram,"I , it's because the playstyles are very different among the two. In solo, you go in with a mindset to perform your personal best, whereas in party you try to synergise well and put more emphasis on the teamwork. Also, it is possible to carry someone in a party to higher MMR and thus boost them, when hey go queue alone with higher skill groups they will perform worse (i.e. less boosters)",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v6q4c/valve_plz_hear_community_no_more_solo_x_party/,RealnoMIs,I forgot that the mindset of players at lower mmr (sub 5k) is different than the mindset of higher mmr players.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v6q4c/valve_plz_hear_community_no_more_solo_x_party/,RealnoMIs,I really dont see any reason why there are different kinds of mmr. If you have a stack with one 5000 mmr player and one 3000 mmr player their average is still 4000 and they will be but along side players of around 4000mmr.

It's just about an individual mmr not meaning anything when in parties that people chose and with players of different skills, so they figured it's better to have a garbage party mmr that means nothing so that solo mmr still means something, only problem is they still mix the two of them for some reason because poor dual stacks need to wait one more minute to ruin solo rank games when they could simply play unranked.",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v6q4c/valve_plz_hear_community_no_more_solo_x_party/,RealnoMIs,I dont see how ones skill would vary depending on if you play with friends or alone. Most people who frequently play solo and party will end up with around the same mmr in both - unless your solo mmr is higher than 5k.,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v6q4c/valve_plz_hear_community_no_more_solo_x_party/,RealnoMIs,Because at 4.5-5k party mmr there are a lot of players (perhaps even a majority) who have 5.9-6.2k solo mmr but 4.4k party and thus it will be hard for you to gain mmr with your 5k average party.,,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v6q4c/valve_plz_hear_community_no_more_solo_x_party/,RealnoMIs,Now why do we have higher party mmr than them? Because we play more party and less solo than them. If they wanted to their party could also be 4.9k average but they just havnt put the games into it.,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v6q4c/valve_plz_hear_community_no_more_solo_x_party/,RealnoMIs,Now i do understand that there is some kind of line where a party of 2 or 3 would be able to win a very high percentage of their games by bringing in a lower mmr friend. Where this line is i dont know. All i know is that if we had only one mmr it wouldnt matter since the mmr would still balance around where their actual skill is compared to everyone else.,,,,

My rating is 3400 or something, it was calibrated a month after ranked was released, and nearly never touched again. That was 2 years ago. Solo MMR is currently at 4900. Big difference. Now I decide to play with my friend, I can play with anyone +/- 2000 MMR from my party MMR.
So I can pick from 1400 to 5400. I pick a 2000 MMR friend. How many games do you reckon I need to play to get my party MMR closer to my solo MMR? My guess is hundreds. Now consider what happens to my friend's MMR. What if I play with other people too? What if my friend too plays with other people? How good the will the match be for the other side?

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vbtd7/diffusal_blade_on_ursa/,,"Hi Guys, 
So I was thinking about this one: 
Why don't people buy Diffusal on Ursa? 
Ursa on general is a Hero who has problems with catching up to his target. With the slow of the Diffusal blade you can make some easy kills in the mid game. 
A big plus is the purge of the Ghost Scepter, which some supports might buy.
Let me know what do you think :D",,,,

Equal parts ice and fire, cunning and rage, the creature known as Jakiro glides over charred and ice-bound battlefields, laying waste to any who would bear arms against it. Pyrexae dragon clutches always contain two fledglings. Famous for their viciousness even from the first moments of life, newly hatched dragons of this species will try to kill their sibling while still in the nest. Only the strongest survive. In this way is the strength of the Pyrexae line ensured. By some accident of nature, the freak Jakiro hatched from a single egg, combining in a single individual the full range of abilities found within the diverse Pyrexae species. Jakiro killed all of it's siblings expect two, Mag and Shard. Jakiro promised not to kill Mag and Shard if they serve by it's side. The four siblings ventured out from the Pyrexae species never to return again. Trapped within the armature of its monstrous body, the powers of ice and fire combine, and now no enemy is safe.",,,,

It is a bit similar to the zelda games from n64. The main character is a white wolf which is actually an incarnation of the Goddess of the Sun (in Shinto mythology). One of the main features of the game is the Celestial Brush, when using it the game pauses and calls up a canvas then you can draw on the screen to use your God powers. For example drawing a circle in the sky changes night into day, painting on broken bridges fixes them. It has really beautiful artwork too, hope you give it a shot. ",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v4fzj/my_friends_and_i_modeled_rigged_and_animated/,YellowJello_,"The textures are painted under flat lighting, so nothing too fancy for that. For the black outlines it might get a little technical. You make a secondary black mesh that covers the whole model for the outline. Reverse the normals and turn backface culling on, so you can see through the black mesh as long as the faces are facing away from you. Because the normals are reversed, you will see through most of the model, except the edges which will still be black giving you the outline effect. To make the outline follow the character's movement, you just bind the outline mesh to the joints of the characters and copy weights/re-adjust as necessary.",,,,

I once used grease pencil in Blender to get this kind of result but this looks better The outline is more natural, mine looked like an edge detection effect. Also which software did you use for this? Since the way you constructed the scene is universal it's interchangeable probably but I'd like to take a look at it. Please keep it up.",,,,

I know it feels like if the unit's health is set to 550, it must be exactly 550, but it's unfortunately not the case.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v5wak/egs_dac_money_finally_paid/,NoLips,Countries levy income tax on the basis of two (main) principles: Residence and source.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v5wak/egs_dac_money_finally_paid/,NoLips,Source means that the source of the money was in a certain territory.

He then flashes out the hero, then he balanes him relative to he pool just so it isnt flat out auto win opness then he releases it to pubs the first stage of balance begins here, then he enable it to captains once he feels the hero is now balanced enough to be tested in the highest levels of play then finally the hero is OSFrog Balance in all things OSFrog enough after finetuning in the next patches.",,,,

Think about how aggresive you feel playing axe and how cunning you feel playing slark the way the spells make you play these heroes affects your mood and feel as well.,,,,

Think of how cold lich makes you feel, how nonchalantly you sacrifice creeps at the begining but how after a while you like the sound of it. How it feels to see chain frost drive your enemies before you and how you then hear the lamentations of their women (just me?)",,,,

Like no personality, no cool spells or ideas, no lore. Here rightclick with this broody lonely ranger whose third spell buffs everyone on the map because she actually likes teaches everybody. her style doesnt change as the game progresses right clink into more rightclick she doesnt make you play in a certain way.",,,,

Playing the hero puts you in their mentality. Similairly consider Ember who at the begining chases you down and hounds you to death but after he gets farm and achieves enlightenment and mastery, he simply relies on one hit to destroy you, it is amazing how his play changes as he levels up.",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v5rk0/idea_for_morphlings_adaptive_strikemorph/,harrytrumanprimate,what if we change morphling aghs to make him have an ice form. it removes his ability to move but he regens a percentage of his health and is immune to physical damage. you can also cast it on your team. Scepter also grants flying unit status and gives your attacks damage over time equal to the percentage of the enemy's hp. Adaptive strike now does nothing to the original target and instead slows and damages nearby ones. Morph becomes a spell where u morph the enemy's loyalty so that they all attack a single enemy. this goes through magic immunity.,,,,

It gave the combo much less surprise and left morphling vulnerable for a brief period between the projectile and instant-adaptive strike. When they 'nerfed' adaptive strike to be a projectile, it actually buffed eblade morph because you can just shift queue the projectiles and they will fly 1 behind the other and you don't have to wait around.

With roaming BH still being fairly viable this makes him kind of a pocket-strat of sorts that actually works out pretty well as long as you can play decently as a team - e.g. gank mid once, the have mid come gank carry, then gank mid again and start five-manning into their carry.

However, if the meta of 6.86 shifts Dota in similar direction that was 6.83, where games start having several single target carries with long lasting games, then Octarine Morph might just be the way to go.  As of right now, I think Vici Gaming have proved that the best way to go offlane morph is with his Aghs upgrade, Hybrid, and with a team drafted around this ability, such as PL or Alch on carry, and also with support Undying.  I think more teams should be experimenting with Hybrid tbh because I think they would be able to come up with some really good combinations.  Like Hybrid Naga Siren.  Two bkb piercing nets and three illusions to cut farm even more aggressively with and push with.  Or Hybrid bat.  The napalm stacks, and having an illusion that gives you high ground vision and does potential damage could be very useful during Rosh fights or base pushes.  Hybrid ET would make stomps area twice as large, meaning it would be incredibly easy to set up a fight.  Maybe Darkseer and two vacuums into a wall or similar combo.

It doesn't grant stats or armor meaning countering evasion completely means removing 100% of an items effective EHP value unlike armor or stats. Thus the item is only valuable until a counter is picked up. If the counter was easy to get, then talisman becomes less and less valuable. ",,,,

While it is true that it causes all heroes to die more, there is a massive threshold that gets crossed when a hero goes from ""never dying"", to ""occcasionally dying"", due to streak gold.

It's just nobody is willing to go out on a limb and try it in the pro scene. They stick to utility puck, because that's all the hero has ever known.",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v6uym/minor_buff_idea_to_pucks_laning/,Luckysheaven,"I think orchid could work in a lot of situations, but the hero itself needs a buff.. like 2-3 base str and +.5 agi gain would solve most of pucks problems imho",,,,

I don't know why Jaunt needs to clutter the UI when it can only be used for the couple seconds after an orb is cast.",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v6uym/minor_buff_idea_to_pucks_laning/,warden5738256,Puck is a leftover hero from when the game had a very limited hero pool and will probably never be relevant again. Mirana is another good example.,,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,romp39,"It is hard to say it is just the fault of the map though. There are specific heroes that benefit from a few small map differences. On radiant midlane you are much closer to jungle camps and ancients. So heroes like SF and TA who are already mmr spammer heroes are at an advantage there. The 'safe' spot for radiant mid is also much better. If you don't know what I mean by safe spot, on radiant, it's the spot South East of the tower where you can move into the trees below tower or down towards medium camp in jungle. On dire the safe spot is basically hugging the trees below tower. Since if you get enemies coming at you from all angles you can break vision much faster on radiant mid than on dire which allows a few seconds more survivablity and forcing opponent to tank a few more tower shots. You can also move into the trees to the North West of radiant mid t1 where as dire you don't have anything similar. Similar situation with radiant safe lane where you can also triple pull where as on dire it's impossible. So basically any heroes that require a good laning stage are always gonna be better on radiant but dire undoubtedly has the rosh advantage. I think creep stacking should be nerfed in some way on radiant since if you are dire and don't pressure the lanes in some way your opponent is getting too much out of the map. ",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet,Just to put in perspective how superior Radiant is over Dire let's just look at the differences and how they benefit each side.,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet," - Radiant jungle is infinitely better for mid lane due to its proximity to the T1 mid tower. Dire jungle is better for dedicated junglers due to half the camps being on highground and having closer proximity to the top rune. Junglers are basically irrelevant in competitive play, and usually so weak in pubs that they barely matter anymore besides a select few.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet," - Radiant's mid lane ramp is much closer to the towers and the trees are oriented towards the jungle with highground on the opposite side, making it very difficult to tower dive Radiant mid compared to Dire. Combined with the jungle differences Radiant mid will get superior farm probably 75% of the time in an even matchup w/ equally skilled players. Dire mid simply has no mechanic to allow him to keep up to Radiant's jungle access.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet," - Dire has a clear advantage over Roshan due to their mid and bottom T1 towers being much closer than Radiant's. Dire is also able to get greater vision over Roshan and a much easier time smoking into Roshan. In the event of Radiant trying to force Roshan, the pit is right next to the Dire T1 bottom tower and Dire Ancients, allowing a very easy blink initiation from Dire.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet," - Dire's offlane is stronger in this patch due to having a direct path into the sideshop from behind the trees and an open path into the Radiant jungle. This offers plenty of room to contest the pull camp or leech XP. Radiant's offlane has access to the Dire hard camp for pulling if they run an aggro trilane that wants to maintain creep equilibrium, but realistically you never see farming aggro trilanes.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet," - Radiant safelane is much harder to tower dive due to their trees having a clearer path with multiple exits that go around the tower. On Dire safelane if you hide in the trees you're generally trapped unless you're carrying a ton of tangos or a TP scroll, but in Radiant there's a second exit to allow you to dodge ganks and get out safely. Radiant also has an easier time warding the middle of their jungle to dodge potential ganks due to Dire's jungle being split between low/highground with lots of random trees.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet," - Radiant has superior rune access due to the runes basically spawning almost directly under their ramps, making it very difficult to contest the runes as Dire unless you have a clearly superior level 1 lineup or Radiant misplays heavily.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet," - Radiant ancients are right next to their mid lane, allowing quick and easy stacking from the Radiant mid right before retrieving the top rune. Dire mid requires at least an extra 5 seconds to reach the ancients in time to stack them, potentially missing out on CS in the lane. Radiant ancients are also much more difficult to contest, as you'll be walking blindly into their highground chokepoint ramp. The common Radiant jungle cliff ward gives vision of Dire's ancients highground whereas you have to go out of your way to ward Radiant's ancients highground.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,7uckingLegit,Nope it isn't. What Radiant has is 1 medium camp close to the mid lane. Which is incredibly hard to stack anyway. ,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,7uckingLegit,"Dire has 3 camps 2 on the highground, so the advantage gets nullified by how dire has more camps even though a bit farther away. The thing you forgot to mention is that all 3 of the camps are easy to double stack. I can as a support  reliably double stack all of the camps on dire and this happens a lot when you walk to rotate around mid, safelane and base. This basically tripples/quadruples the amount that a Dire support could stack for his midlaner compared to Radiant.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,7uckingLegit,Bullshit. Having a smaller ramp and closer trees makes it much easier to ambush and surprise the enemy mid laner with support or even offlane rotations. When was the last time you saw a Radiant offlaner rotating mid?. I agree it's more difficult to dive Radiant but that gets nullified by how easy it is to just catch a Radiant mid hero.,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,7uckingLegit,You just need 1 tango or quelling blade and Dire trees become a nightmare. When was the last time you saw no one in the safelane have a tango OR a quelling blade?,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,7uckingLegit,Agreed. This is IMO Radiants only big advantage. But since we already have oh so many advantages in Dire it's not hard to see why captain favour that side or why Dires winrate is higher in competitive games.,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,7uckingLegit,"Dire ancients are easily stacked on the way to the rune too, the difference is that the bot rune is farther away from the midlane than to the toplane. Saying how there is a 5 second delay makes me think you never played TA/Beastmaster/Alche on dire side. And no, Dire ancients are more difficult to contest since it's on the lowground, making Ancient farming safer and much much easier to counter if someone tries to contest.",,,,

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet,It's actually really easy to stack if you take 5 seconds to learn the timing and positioning. You must not play Radiant mid very much?,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet,"How does it Triple or Quadruple your potential stacks? In the first 10 minutes you're limited to 11 potential jungle stacks unless you have a support who can double/triple stack and can execute it properly. So I guess if your support were to afk in the jungle for the entire 10 minutes and be level 3 due to constantly rotating from lane to jungle every minute you could get 11 jungle stacks on Dire, but I've never in my 2000+ dota games seen a support that dedicated to his pub mid laner. Usually in Mid you have to stack for yourself, or if you get lucky your support will stack the closest camps 3-4 times. You aren't gonna be double or triple stacking the camps and your support isn't gonna sit in the jungle stacking every potential camp for you. Radiant's camps are closer, allowing the support to commit less time to stacking and more time to roaming or helping you in the lane.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet,"How is it easier to catch Radiant mid? His ramp is right next to the rune so he's harder to gank at the rune. The mid lane ramp is right next to his tower so again, it's harder to gank him if he just hugs his tower. Sure you can tower dive him but his trees are much easier to juke around than Dire's, so I'm not sure where you get this idea that Radiant is easier to ambush? I'll give you that you can catch him farming his jungle stacks or contest his stacks but if he just sits mid and farms you'll have a very hard time ganking him. This is why teams put heroes like Lycan or Naga Siren in mid lane and more teams are putting the 1 position mid on Radiant, because it's way harder to gank. Dire side often put their 2 position mid against Radiant's 1 because they expect him to get less farm anyway.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet,"This is true but Radiant has a much easier tree path by default. You don't need to buy items to be able to juke around Radiant's trees, whereas Dire requires you to have a TP scroll or Tangos or QB to cut yourself a path, Radiant already has a perfectly good path that goes directly under the tower, making it very difficult to tower dive. Dire's path is far away from the tower, so not only do you not have vision of the enemy heroes but the tower won't attack them even if you do get vision.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,Remi-Scarlet,"I was just saying Radiant's rune ward gives vision of the highground leading to the Ancients. If you want to contest the Ancients there's a perfectly easy ubercliff behind the T1 tower that gives total vision of the Ancients and Secret Shop. The Radiant ubercliff only gives vision of the Secret Shop and the Rune, which is a pretty weak ward spot. To ward Radiant's Ancient you have to go to their highground and potentially get ganked, which is about the same risk as warding Dire's ubercliff except it gives less useful vision since Dire's cliff also gives vision of the tower.",,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,7uckingLegit,Bwahaha I played dedicated support since back in DotA1 days. I even know the timings of when you can start attacking the jungle camps at ~4x seconds and still get reliable stacks. That doesn't change the face that the medium camp is a total pain in the ass to stack unless you get good neutral spawns. Can u imagine now stacking that camp more than once?.,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v90k9/icefrog_please_buff_dire/,7uckingLegit,"A radiant support can only stack the large camp reliably. Medium camp is at most stacked once and you cant double stack(stack both at the same times with spells). So that leaves him to go all the way to the edge of the jungle(Which isn't even on the way to base from the safelane like the one dire). To stack 1 camp. Now lets look at Dire support stacking. You can double stack all of the camps easily, which means you're already doubling the radiants stacks. Now you get 1 additional medium camp thats easily double stacked too, (or even stacked by the mid while taking the rune. dragon slave,shadow raze etc). Do you see now how you easily quadruple a radiant supports stack?. All the while being only a quick detour from the safelane-base route.",,,,

However, Alchemist can counter this by eating 3 scepters for himself (they would stack in this instance), thus gaining a new ability, ""imperialism"", where he forces his capitalist greed onto every player in the match, siphoning half of their gold per second for a short period of time. Allied players can try to counter this by stacking their scepters to have more than aclhemist and thus nullify his capitalist greed, however, Alchemist gains a new ultimate ability ""Red Scare"", which tricks every player into thinking that communism is a bad thing, thus replacing the ""communism"" effect with one that does damage per second if attempted to use.

Moon is a hype as fuck offlaner and definitely was among the best (with zai) when he played, but Khezu who recently switched to dota2 has enough lan victories to earn himself the title of best HoN offlaner of all time. Limmp was the best 1v1 player, up until Micke (the sumail of Hon) showed up, and he just recently switched to dota as well.

That is - she does really need these +10 all stats, HP and mana, because of her manashield and tendencies to have stat-heavy builds (scadi, manta, etc.).,

That's why I thought that there should definitely be aghanims upgrade to one of her skills, and I outlined the following options:,
1) 4 dmg per mana (mana shield), up from 2.5,
2) mana shield blocks damage AFTER reductions (currently before),
3) petrifying duration from 3 secs to 1.5 (time needed for enemy to turn to stone). Because who on earth really gets petrified these days?,
4) no penalty on split shot (80% dmg -> 100%),

To see someone from that world putting it together with other martial art forms in such a disciplined, precise and effective manner basically blew my mind. When he first KO'ed Rashad Evans, I was going insane. But him getting beat by Shogun just reminds me of how awesome and unpredictable this sport is and why I love it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v9ilt/puppey_vs_kuroky_9hrs_from_now/,Sesc123,Actually Liquid was almost unmatched when it came to closing out games. Even when they were about to lose their lead they basically never tilted. Almost every game they played casters said how much of a game plan Liquid had and how precisely Kuro is leading them. Saying he is a bad captain is beyond retarded considering that they only play together for like 3 months.

Been stuck in it for a couple days now and I honestly NEVER want to be back in this shit hole ever again. This is the worst punishment I've ever had to endure. I could probably compare it to prison to be honest. At least the people you're in a holding cell with don't use racist slurs at you, threaten your mom, or wish death upon you. So, Valve, congratulations. You finally got the low priority system right. If I ever get out of this trench, I will never leave another game again. ",,,,

He even approached it with a very open-minded attitude and was interested in it, even at the end of his last Dota stream. I'd assume he is open to playing Dota again, but the learning curve being so steep and the lack of intuitive resources for noobs to learn from has probably deterred him from playing more frequently. Yet another example of why Valve needs to step up its tutorials and its efforts to making Dota more newbie-friendly.",,,,

Everybody probably realized something had to be done but everybody else were probably on longer contracts. The other four probably also had an easier time accepting the odd man out to be Nuts rather than one of them. Market value is also higher for the four remaining. This in addition to the, assumed, contractual bits probably made this the only change they could possibly consider now that was not a full disband.

Did he know there was a troll in that camp before they got there so he had enough time to request a sentry drop? Did he just yell drop a sentry and SB instantly did it? Seems like really fast thinking/acting for both of them.,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v8a73/next_level_dark_troll_play/,jigg4,"I assume they saw/knew they were chased and also were aware of the shadow blade on the enemy.

Call it the: fuck you buy it compendium. Every 100 dollars you pay, valve will give you one piece of a set of their choosing (either the sniper or sniper set pieces, the other ones displayed aren't actually in the game until a certain, undisclosed amount of money is spent on the sniper pieces) once you have a full sniper set, you will be able to exchange the full set, all of your compendium coins, and another 100 dollars for a 2 minute video of Gaben at his computer looking at the suggested learn tab In all its glory. He will be explaining all the new features but the amount of food in his mouth will make it difficult to understand anything he's saying other than ""sometime next month"" and ""only costs 100 dollars per person"" at this point, after following his instructions, valve will mail you an activation code (after paying another ~100 dollars for shipping of course) which you may or may not receive based on nothing. The activation code will take you to a secure valve link which will be revealed only after laying the 100 dollar revelation fee. After paying the fee, a portion of the learn tab will be available but will only work when it feels like it. Eventually the entire thing will be released for one low payment of 100 dollars (after doing everything else of course, valve employees have to eat too)",,,,

I am quite stable in writing and talking and I nearly understand everything in english that is not oddly specific. I even can read scientific papers about some topics without getting lost. Still I am by far not perfect. I quitted that school after 5 years because I had the feeling to not make it. I switched to the middle skill school level. It was a special Class where people of all skill levels are combined...hard to explain why I had to go there. in short it was tailored to get all skill levels to the same final degree, ""middle skilled"", so naturaly it was easy for me and others that took the same route but hard for people from the lower skilled schools.
