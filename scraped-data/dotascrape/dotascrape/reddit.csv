"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3txhvd/shanghai_major_shuffle_mega_thread/,Chocobarucho,I'm a little disagree with you. No beef at all but Niqua playing Mid or Carry to make room for Pajkatt's flashy hero is a big adjustment for 4CL which are performing really well right now.

You need 1 cheese, 2 sets of tangoes, 2 mangoes and a stout shield(the plate), 1 courier and one bladed weapon(not consumed) in the inventory. Bladed weapon determines the buff(like 10 evasion if it's butterfly). Borrowed weapon adds ""Teamwork"" effect that grants 100 sight from teammates and +2 armor per teammate in 900 radius for the duration of the buff. If you cast a fire on the Feast it turns into the Pizza of Champions, a slice of which can be taken by allied heroes during the duration for an instant 300 mana and health restore. Feast can be stolen(and instantly eaten)  by enemy hero instantly restoring 1000 health and mana."

I mean mango gives a burst of mana maybe a HP burst item would be cool. Furthermore the item could give passive mana regen to compliment support players which would pick up the item. Like the mango after like 3 uses or 1 then it destroys. This could be a really clutch item as early on itd be like a wand with 7 charges without the mana burst instantly.

You tell your team that you will never fight with them. You tell your team that you will split push. You do this in a nice way because you are Lycan picker and you want to win. You buy stout, quelling, tangoes in that exact order. You go jungle. You get: level 7, 4-0-2-1 skill build. You have: vlads, quelling, stout, smoke. You smoke and take rosh before 10 minutes. You time that motherfucker. You buy brown boots. You go push a lane or take ancients if there is no safe lane to push. You repeat until game is won. You never fight with your team ever. You never fight without your team ever. Wolves need no armour. Why do wolves need no armour you may ask? Wolves need no armour because wolves never fight; wolves split push. This is why wolves need no armour. Your team dying 4 mid? You do not fight with them. You do not teleport to them. You do not flame them. You are Lycan and you want to win. You have teleportation scrolls but you use them to get to lanes as far away from danger as possible and push. You tell your team to fight under tower. You tell your team not to come to your lane. You do this in a nice way because even though wolves need no armour wolves want to win games. If you are getting ganked (you should be looking at the mini map and not be in a situation where you’re getting ganked) but if you are getting ganked you know what to do: you listen to Lycan and Lycan tells you what? That’s right you sonofabitch: Lycan tells you that ""the wolf runs"". You pop that ultimate, you back off and you TP out. You push another lane or you farm jungle/farm ancients/smoke roshan. If you don't know what to do then what do you do? That's right; you listen to Lycan again and Lycan tells you that ""the wolf runs"" and that ""wolves need no armour"". This does not mean ""the wolf fights""; it means that the wolf go split push. You are on a lane preferably furthest away from danger. You are in the jungle or at the ancients farming. You are at roshan getting that aegis timing that shit. You get necro 1, 2, 3. You upgrade your brown boots into boots of travel. You do it in this exact order. You keep that split push going. You smoke rosh whenever he's up. You keep telling your team not to be with you or come to your lanes. You are Lycan. You are nice about it. You are split push. You are objectives. You are win. You remember that ""wolves love to battle"" against structures because then wolves will need no armour and wolves can run in circles around the structures. You never fight. You end the game with 0-0-0 and the highest building damage ever conceived by man."

All right, I think many people are waiting for me to comment. I haven't been mistaken yet in situations that involve myself. It is the same this time =) It was my the most successful team and I wanted to stay with them. But to regret about something or to think about how something could have been is not for me. I'll continue to move forward as I've always did. I do not consider myself better or worse than someone else. I'll continue to improve and I'll not compare myself to anyone. There is only one thing I ask: do not blame the guys who made this decision. Give them time and they will show themself, be tolerate. I had quite a lot of drawbacks they didn't want to put up with, that's all. All this was done right and for greater results. The life and the following matches will tell. Do not blame people for opting for hopes for the best.  "

He was being active around the map and got his monstrous farm where he could fight and carry in the late game, while Illidan (as we've seen in the last major), was running around with 300 gpm on a carry role.

"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v4dow/silent_to_replace_illidan_in_virtuspro/,Ice_Cream_Warrior,"Hope this means some more success for VP. A lot of people think Illidan worked well and meant they could play other heroes (silencer, venge, drow, weaver) but the more you watched their games and not just one offs the more it kind of seems that if they had drafted more to meta and had their 1 position hero farming at +500gpm every game they probably would've won more. Its hard to tell how much of this playstyle is the teams direction or Illidan's own personal style (wanting these heroes and not farming) and it did seem they would sacrifice his farm and protection for both G's and lil's sometimes. Illidan would often turn into the 3rd hero on the farm chart and be almost a support hero in the late game to help out G as the main core and one of Lil or DK on a playmaker/burst damage hero. His laning presence still seemed not fantastic, especially when they did adequately support him, and it just seemed that his lack of playing more normal 1 position heroes really then made late games very hard for VP if they didn't snowball to wins in 25 mins. His late game play also seems somewhat mechanically lacking (out of position a lot, too slow on bkbs etc) and it will be interesting to see how VP plays with a different core. I think Illidan was much stronger and very important in their play pre-Ti5 to establish them as a top 10 team, and then their run into Ti5 and getting them a top 6 finish TI. Hope he finds success, but as a fan of the team more-so than specifically Illidan, I think this change instantly improves them and hope that Silent can rejuvenate the team out of their kinda post ti slump."

"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v5wak/egs_dac_money_finally_paid/,NoLips,Very basic general explanation:
"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v5wak/egs_dac_money_finally_paid/,NoLips,Countries levy income tax on the basis of two (main) principles: Residence and source. Residence means if you are a resident of a country you are liable for income tax on your worldwide income. EG boys are resident in US/Canada so their DAC winnings are liable to US income tax based on residence.
"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v5wak/egs_dac_money_finally_paid/,NoLips,Source means that the source of the money was in a certain territory. So all money that is sourced in a territory is liable to be taxed by that territory. The DAC winnings are sourced in China hence liable to Chinese income tax.
"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v5wak/egs_dac_money_finally_paid/,NoLips,"This is the problem facing EG. China wants to tax it based on source and US/Canada wants to tax based on residence. Double tax. It can be complicated to get around this sometimes but usually it's not a problem to avoid paying the double tax. Usually it works out that you pay income tax to one country according to the treaty rules and then you get tax credits which can be applied to your income in the other country, which means you effectively avoid the second round of tax (mostly)."

"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v5rk0/idea_for_morphlings_adaptive_strikemorph/,harrytrumanprimate,what if we change morphling aghs to make him have an ice form. it removes his ability to move but he regens a percentage of his health and is immune to physical damage. you can also cast it on your team. Scepter also grants flying unit status and gives your attacks damage over time equal to the percentage of the enemy's hp. Adaptive strike now does nothing to the original target and instead slows and damages nearby ones. Morph becomes a spell where u morph the enemy's loyalty so that they all attack a single enemy. this goes through magic immunity.

"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v5rk0/idea_for_morphlings_adaptive_strikemorph/,tehvoiceofreason,"Before, when Eblade originally got the projectile nerf, the shotgun combo was terrible because you would use ether blast, then have to wait until that projectile hit before you could use the instant adaptive strike. It gave the combo much less surprise and left morphling vulnerable for a brief period between the projectile and instant-adaptive strike. When they 'nerfed' adaptive strike to be a projectile, it actually buffed eblade morph because you can just shift queue the projectiles and they will fly 1 behind the other and you don't have to wait around. "

Plus part of why offlane morph was semi-viable was his ability to contribute decently to teamfights pretty early on - basically right as the laning stage broke down. With roaming BH still being fairly viable this makes him kind of a pocket-strat of sorts that actually works out pretty well as long as you can play decently as a team - e.g. gank mid once, the have mid come gank carry, then gank mid again and start five-manning into their carry. A 4.5 second stun on 10 (or 7 once you get octarine) sec CD is undeniably really good but the only way it works is by keeping the pressure high enough. "

"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v4fzj/my_friends_and_i_modeled_rigged_and_animated/,rionyamato,"just one of the best games ever (2006 Game of the year Playstation 2). It is a bit similar to the zelda games from n64. The main character is a white wolf which is actually an incarnation of the Goddess of the Sun (in Shinto mythology). One of the main features of the game is the Celestial Brush, when using it the game pauses and calls up a canvas then you can draw on the screen to use your God powers. For example drawing a circle in the sky changes night into day, painting on broken bridges fixes them. It has really beautiful artwork too, hope you give it a shot. "

For the black outlines it might get a little technical. You make a secondary black mesh that covers the whole model for the outline. Reverse the normals and turn backface culling on, so you can see through the black mesh as long as the faces are facing away from you. Because the normals are reversed, you will see through most of the model, except the edges which will still be black giving you the outline effect. To make the outline follow the character's movement, you just bind the outline mesh to the joints of the characters and copy weights/re-adjust as necessary."

I'd have to experiment a lot to get this right. I once used grease pencil in Blender to get this kind of result but this looks better The outline is more natural, mine looked like an edge detection effect. Also which software did you use for this? Since the way you constructed the scene is universal it's interchangeable probably but I'd like to take a look at it. Please keep it up."

Moon is a hype as fuck offlaner and definitely was among the best (with zai) when he played, but Khezu who recently switched to dota2 has enough lan victories to earn himself the title of best HoN offlaner of all time. Limmp was the best 1v1 player, up until Micke (the sumail of Hon) showed up, and he just recently switched to dota as well. Hon's talent pool was small but very very very deep, and each one of these players is finding or will find great success. "

"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v5j8z/synderens_new_lineup/,coopdegrace,As for slickz he was considered the best in the world for a small time because of his beastmode showing on lans but besides his short and amazing run with SG he really didn't accomplish anything before or after. Still showed the most potential of any player though.

With Refraction she can negate a small number of damage instances, and have a few enhanced attacks of her own. She can Meld into the shadows at any time, but must remain still to keep hidden. If she strikes from the shadows, she will deal additional damage and lower her target's armor. The Templar Assassin's Psi Blades can be thrown from moderate range, and actually pierce her targets to deal damage further in a line. Her ability to place Psionic Traps from great distances, which slow nearby targets on activation, makes her nearly impossible to escape from. While she is able to create a number of disadvantages for her opponents, if caught with her guard down she will quickly fall."

"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v35e2/hero_discussion_of_the_week_lanaya_the_templar/,,"Lanaya, the Templar Assassin, came to her calling by a path of curious inquiry. Possessed of a scientific bent, she spent her early years engaged in meticulous study of nature's laws--peering into grimoires of magic and alchemy, recreating experiments from charred fragments of the Violet Archives, and memorizing observations of the Keen recordkeepers. Already quiet and secretive by nature, the difficulty of acquiring these objects further reinforced her skills of stealth. Had she been less retiring, she might have become notorious among the guilds as a thief-scholar. Instead her investigations led her into far more obscure corners. As she devoted her furtive talents to unlocking the secrets of the universe, she instead unlocked a secret door that exists in nature itself: the entryway to the most Hidden Temple. The intelligences that waited beyond that portal, proved to be expecting her, and whatever mysteries they revealed in the moment of their discovery was nothing compared to the answers they held out to Lanaya should she continue in their service. She swore to protect the mysteries, but more to the point, in service to the Hidden Temple she satisfies her endless craving for understanding. In the eyes of each foe she expunges, a bit more of the mystery is revealed."

She hasn't had significant changes to her skills in a very long time but is always a hero you have to watch out for because of how scary she is when she snowballs. 
"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v35e2/hero_discussion_of_the_week_lanaya_the_templar/,phasmy,Refraction is her most important skill that allows her to be very hard to kill while at the same time giving her a strong damage bonus for last hitting. Meld is a physical damage nuke that reduces armor to make her kill her targets even faster. Psi Blades is a unique skill that when used properly can allow her to dominate the mid lane even further. It also allows the farming of creeps/stacks in a timely manner. Her ultimate is a strong vision tool and disable to chase her targets. 
"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v35e2/hero_discussion_of_the_week_lanaya_the_templar/,phasmy,I think some of her significant buffs in recent patches are changes to some of her core items: Blink Dagger and Desolator. Desolator cost was reduced to 3500. The de facto TA build nowadays is to rush Desolator to accelerate your farm and potentially kill Roshan early by yourself. Blink dagger does NOT go on cooldown while you have refraction charges up which makes TA impossible to kill without proper disables.

"title default, Page: 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3v35e2/hero_discussion_of_the_week_lanaya_the_templar/,disco_deer,"If you max meld 1st, you can outharrass ember in the laning stage, but he has a lot of kill potential against you especially once he hits lvl 6. There was a TA 2 days ago on RTZ stream which killed him on lvl 5 because it was a lvl 3 meld that he didn't expect, because pros usually have a 3-0-2-1 build on lvl 6 to maximize farming speed. Post-laning stage, it really only depends on the team, if your teammates disable ember, you kill him really fast as a TA because he's bad against physical dmg (bad stats, low armor, no armor items as a part of the build), but if you are the one who's disabled as TA, he removes your refractions really quickly and probably kills you off.

Most of the time when people go blink first, they lack the damage necessary to get the job done after having blinked in.

More often than not though, you'll probably want a bkb.  crit-stick is nice but i've found it falls off very hard if you dont plan to build something for attack speed. I used to go AC but these days I think I'd recommend a butterfly, AC lets you tank more but your refraction should be doing that for you first, Butterfly means if they miss they miss your refraction which is almost kinda  sudo refraction if you want to think of it like that.

It requires no mana to use, just good timing and positioning. If you're lucky and your opponent doesnt know how to position to use psi blades they probably wont know how to avoid them either making it really easy for you to get damage off on your lane opponent with out taking any creep agro your self, on top of that its pure damage which means it fucks them all sorts of good. If you're having trouble getting meld strikes off or just harassing in lane, some times 2 points into psi are good to have. refraction + meld is an easy way to send your lane opponent back to base or at least leave them scared  under tower.

Getting phase with its higher raw damage and quick burst of speed is better for a high damage build with mkb/daedalus after deso and blink.  Getting threads is more of a sustained damage output to make use of the attack speed and being tankier and usually moves onto more defensive items such as manta/bkb to be able to stick to a target and utilize all the refraction damage.

I'm surprised no one mentioned Waga in a Templar Assassin discussion.  The dude literally ate, slept and BREATHED TA at one point during his streaming marathons.  He's arguably the best pub TA in the world, and even though he may not be having success competitively, his TA is still commonly respect banned.  This is arguably the best TA guide out there.  Check it out."

She's so fun to play, but I constantly feel the pressure of having to finish he game before 35~40 minutes. Maybe the pressure adds to the fun.
